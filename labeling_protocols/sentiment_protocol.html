    <title>Sentiment for software engineering labeling protocol</title>

<body>

We classify text for positive and negative sentiment.
The notation of sentiment is quite subjective.
Hence the general advice is more important than the usual here:in case of doubt, mark as uncertain".
<BR>
<B>Instructions</B>

<ol>
  <li>The sentiment should be directly in the text.
      Hence, though other models consider 'easy', 'important' or 'hopefully' to be positive sentiment, we don't.
      Indeed, the hope of positive outcome and sentiment due to doing an important task easily is understandable
      , it is not direct.
  </li>
  <li>For many phrases, is it not clear if it should be associated with a sentiment.
      A good way to solve that is to sample a set of texts containing it and make a general rule.
      Note that for most case precision is more important than recall so: "Better safe than sorry"
  </li>
  <li>A text might contain both positive and negative sentiment. For example "better" and "sorry".</li>
  <li>As always, context is very important in understanding the meaning.
      Have in mind that software engineering context might be very different from the common one.
      The term "better" in "I implemented a better sorting algorithm" is descriptive, not a sentiment.
      This is true even if the developer will find out in the code review that the term "better" is also arguable.
  </li>
  <li>Though a term might have a sentiment in general, the way it used is important.
      Hence, "Better safe than sorry" is neither positive nor negative sentiment.
  </li>
    <li> Politeness pose an interesting problem for sentiment analysis.
         A developer saying "thank you" in a commit message expresses a positive sentiment though probably not due
        to technical content of the commit.
        We consider politeness to be positive sentiment.
        We are aware that for some use cases this decision should be opposite.
        Since politeness terms are few and identifiable, this decision is easily revertable and therefore not critical.
    </li>
    <li> As an implementation detail, there is a dedicated model for swearing.
        However, for labeling swearing should be considered as negative sentiment.</li>
    <Li>"Quick and dirty", the common reference to dirt is programming is negative sentiment. And it is also bad.</Li>
    <li> 'Good' and 'bad' are descriptive. However, they are culturally deeply related with sentiment so usaally people don't
explicitly write that good is a positive sentiment. Unless the text contradicts that, we will accept 'good' and
 'bad' as their corresponding sentiment. </li>
 </ol>
