    <title>Sentiment for software engineering labeling protocol</title>
</head>
<body>

We classify text for positive and negative sentiment.
The notation of sentiment is quite subjective.
Hence the general advice is more important than the usual here:in case of doubt, mark as uncertain".
<BR>
<B>Instructions</B>

<ol>
  <li>The sentiment should be directly in the text.
      Hence, though other models consider 'easy', 'important' or 'hopefully' to be positive sentiment, we don't.
      Indeed, the hope of positive outcome and sentiment due to doing an important task easily is understandable
      , it is not direct.
  </li>
  <li>For many phrases, is it not clear if it should be associated with a sentiment.
      A good way to solve that is to sample a set of texts containing it and make a general rule.
      Note that for most case precision is more important than recall so: "Better safe than sorry"
  </li>
  <li>A text might contain both positive and negative sentiment. For example "better" and "sorry".</li>
  <li>As always, context is very important in understanding the meaning.
      Have in mind that software engineering context might be very different from the common one.
      The term "better" in "I implemented a better sorting algorithm" is descriptive, not a sentiment.
      This is true even if the developer will find out in the code review that the term "better" is also arguable.
  </li>
  <li>Though a term might have a sentiment in general, the way it used is important.
      Hence, "Better safe than sorry" has netiehr positive or negative sentiment.
  </li>
 </ol>
