We classify text reflection abstraction.
The abstraction should be intended and meaningful.
The notation of abstraction and its reflection is quite subjective and the following instruction try to clarify the intent.

<BR>
<B>Instructions</B>

<ol>
    <li> A reference to abstraction is required. </li>
    <li> References to some abstraction mechanism (e.g., inheritance) are considered reference to abstraction. </li>
    <li> An abstraction which is nowadays trivial and minor (e.g., iterator) is not considered abstraction. </li>
    <li> An abstraction which is a term that became too wide (e.g., user interface, desgin) is not considered abstraction </li>
    <li> A reference to a component doing abstraction (e.g. IData interface) is not enough. </li>
    <li> A reference to abstraction goals or methods (e.g., reuse, composition) are a strong hint for abstraction.
        However, one should verify that it is used for abstraction (e.g., not reuse token). </li>
 </ol>
