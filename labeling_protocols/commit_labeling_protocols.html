<body>


We base our taxonomy on the taxonomy of
<a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Characteristics-of-application-software-maintenance-Lientz-Swanson/2821ee262ee92a8c5c5bb90cda7d0702e9f61af5?p2df">“Characteristics of Application Software Maintenance”</a>
The main difference in taxonomy is that we add a refactoring as a sub-category inside perfective.
Other than that, we provide detailed protocols referring to cases that are usualy not considered by the high level definition.

We divide commits into
<ol>
  <li>Corrective - <a href="corrective_protocol.html">bug fixes</a>.</li>
  <li>Adaptive - <a href="adaptive_protocol.html">implementation of new features</a>.</li>
  <li>Perfective - <a href="perfective_protocol.html">improvement of current system with out changing its functionality. Typically documentation or refactoring</a></li>
  <li>Refactor - <a href="refactor_protocol.html">improvement of system design without changing its functionality (part of perfective)</a></li>
  <li>Other - whatever not fall into the above. Should be a small category</li>
</ol>



<B>Task</B>

Our goal is to label git commit message and decide on its type.
A commit might have several types (e.g., corrective and refactor), hence each labeling protocol and label should be followed independently.


For each commit we should following fields:
<ol>
  <li>Is_Corrective, taking the values, True, False and ? (as intermediate value)</li>
  <li>Is_Adaptive, taking the values, True, False and ? (as intermediate value)</li>
  <li>Is_Perfective, taking the values, True, False and ? (as intermediate value)</li>
  <li>Is_Refactor, taking the values, True, False and ? (as intermediate value)</li>
  <li>Justification which is the reason based on the text for the classification.</li>
  <li>Certain, mark cases in which the annotator is not sure in the label</li>
  <li>Comment, free text adding more information</li>
</ol>




The labeling is based on the commit message for each commit.
Ideally this will be enough for the classification.
If needed, the commit content, linked ticket and other data can be used for finding the commit type.
