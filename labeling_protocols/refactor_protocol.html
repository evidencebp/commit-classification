<ol>
  <li>Perfective and refactor</li>

        <li>Clean up is perfective and refactor.</li>
        <li>Moving code to a different file is perfective and refactor.</li>
        <li>Optimization/Performance improvement is perfective. If the same algorithm is kept, it is also a refactor.</li>
        <li>Unification  is perfective and refactor.</li>
        <li>Re implementation is perfective and refactor</li>
        <li>Simplifying is perfective and refactor</li>
        <li>Renaming entities is perfective and refactor.</li>
        <li>Removing unused code (and deprecated code) is perfective and refactor.</li>
        <li>Reimplementation is perfective and refactor.</li>
    </ol>
  <li>Perfective but not refactor</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Improving style is perfective yet not a refactor.</li>
        <li>Clean up not in code (e.g., documentation) is perfective but not a refactor </li>
        <li>Fix documentation, adding documentation - perfective but not refactor.</li>
        <li>Indentation, code style changes  are perfective but not refactor</li>

    </ol>
        <li> When <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/">conventional commits</a> appear, we base the decision upon them.
    The label 'refactor' is refactor.</li>
