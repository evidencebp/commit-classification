We follow the taxonomy of
<a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Characteristics-of-application-software-maintenance-Lientz-Swanson/2821ee262ee92a8c5c5bb90cda7d0702e9f61af5?p2df">“Characteristics of Application Software Maintenance”</a>

We divide commits into
<ol>
  <li>Corrective - fixes. For bug fix protocol see the CCP labeling protocol.</li>
  <li>Adaptive - implementation of new features</li>
  <li>Perfective - improvement of current system</li>
  <li>Refactor - a perfective action. Code <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">refactoring</a> is the process of restructuring existing computer code—changing
      the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_(computer_science)">factoring</a> — without changing its external behavior (wikipedia)
</li>
  <li>Other - whatever not fall into the above. Should be a small category</li>
</ol>

<BR>
<B>Specific cases</B>

<ol>
  <li>Perfective and refactor</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Clean up is perfective and refactor.</li>
        <li>Moving code to a different file is perfective and refactor.</li>
        <li>Optimization/Performance improvement is perfective. If the same algorithm is kept, it is also a refactor.</li>
        <li>Unification  is perfective and refactor.</li>
        <li>Re implementation is perfective and refactor</li>
        <li>Simplifying is perfective and refactor</li>
        <li>Renaming entities is perfective and refactor.</li>
        <li>Removing unused code (and deprecated code) is perfective and refactor.</li>
        <li>Reimplementation is perfective and refactor.</li>
    </ol>
  <li>Perfective but not refactor</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Improving style is perfective yet not a refactor.</li>
        <li>Clean up not in code (e.g., documentation) is perfective but not a refactor </li>
        <li>Fix documentation, adding documentation - perfective but not refactor.</li>
        <li>Indentation, code style changes  are perfective but not refactor</li>

    </ol>
  <li>Corrective</li>
        <ol>
        <li>See <a href="corrective_protocol.html">the corrective protocol</a></li>
    </ol>

  <li>Adaptive</li>
        <ol>
             <li>Debug message/ feature aimed not to the end user - adaptive. We consider the features for programmers as part of the features.</li>
             <li>Changing an interface is adaptive.</li>
             <li>Updating a library is adaptive</li>
             <li>Porting code is adaptive</li>

        </ol>
  <li>Merge are judged by content. Lacking information, default is adaptive since the merge action itself adapt the software</li>
  <li>In case of a commit the has some categories (e.g., adaptive and perfective), we won’t consider the perfective since we aim for a model of high precision.</li>
</ol>
