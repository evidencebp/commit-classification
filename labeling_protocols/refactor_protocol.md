Specific cases


  1. Perfective and refactor
    <ol>
        1. Clean up is perfective and refactor.
        1. Moving code to a different file is perfective and refactor.
        1. Optimization/Performance improvement is perfective. If the same algorithm is kept, it is also a refactor.
        1. Unification  is perfective and refactor.
        1. Re implementation is perfective and refactor
        1. Simplifying is perfective and refactor
        1. Renaming entities is perfective and refactor.
        1. Removing unused code (and deprecated code) is perfective and refactor.
        1. Reimplementation is perfective and refactor.
        1. Fixing static analyzer alerts is perfective and refactor.
    
  Perfective but not refactor
    
        1. Improving style is perfective yet not a refactor.
        1. Clean up not in code (e.g., documentation) is perfective but not a refactor 
        1. Fix documentation, adding documentation - perfective but not refactor.
        1. Indentation, code style changes  are perfective but not refactor

    
         When [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) appear, we base the decision upon them.
    The label 'refactor' is refactor.
