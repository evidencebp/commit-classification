After a successful SRP login response we call scsi_unblock_requests() to
kick any pending IOs. The callback to process this SRP response happens in
a tasklet and therefore is in softirq context. The result of such is that
when blk-mq is enabled, it is no longer safe to call scsi_unblock_requests()
from this context. The result of duing so triggers the following WARN_ON
splat in dmesg after a host reset or CRQ reenablement.

SAP/openui5,7ae68781ae006604d1a00ceefa7c08dd037473dd,"[INTERNAL] sap.ui.documentation: Apply same excludes in .library and pom.xml

While the Maven based tooling applies excludes defined in either pom.xml
or .library files, UI5 Tooling only uses those defined in .library files.

In an effort to replace the Maven based tooling with UI5 Tooling, the
same excludes must be used.

For the Maven based tooling however, it might make sense to define
excludes in the pom.xml. Compared to .libary excludes, they are applied
earlier and prevent the Maven based tooling from analyzing the excluded
files. This can be necessary for cases where new JavaScript syntax is
used or other problems with the (legacy) Maven build tooling occur.

In order to keep the current setup working but to also apply the same
excludes for UI5 Tooling, they shall be defined in both places, pom.xml
and .library.

A separate change in sapui5.runtime has been crated to add a comment
to the pom.xml, indicating that the excludes need to be kept in sync:

Move the register slow register write and readback from out of the
critical path for execlists submission and delay it until the following
worker, shaving off around 200us. Note that the same signal_irq_work() is
allowed to run concurrently on each CPU (but it will only be queued once,
once running though it can be requeued and reexecuted) so we have to
remember to lock the global interactions as we cannot rely on the
signal_irq_work() itself providing the serialisation (in constrast to a
tasklet).

By pushing the arm/disarm into the central signaling worker we can close
the race for disarming the interrupt (and dropping its associated
GT wakeref) on parking the engine. If we loose the race, that GT wakeref
may be held indefinitely, preventing the machine from sleeping while
the GPU is ostensibly idle.

v2: Move the self-arming parking of the signal_irq_work to a flush of
the irq-work from intel_breadcrumbs_park().

tprrt/linux-stable,3b13758f51de30618d9c7f3fc174d8d1a3cb13cd,"cgroups: Allow dynamically changing net_classid

The classid of a process is changed either when a process is moved to
or from a cgroup or when the net_cls.classid file is updated.
Previously net_cls only supported propogating these changes to the
cgroup's related sockets when a process was added or removed from the
cgroup. This means it was neccessary to remove and re-add all processes
to a cgroup in order to update its classid. This change introduces
support for doing this dynamically - i.e. when the value is changed in
the net_cls_classid file, this will also trigger an update to the
classid associated with all sockets controlled by the cgroup.
This mimics the behaviour of other cgroup subsystems.
net_prio circumvents this issue by storing an index into a table with
each socket (and so any updates to the table, don't require updating
the value associated with the socket). net_cls, however, passes the
socket the classid directly, and so this additional step is needed.

We're going to be adding a few new barrier primitives, and in order to
avoid endless duplication make more agressive use of
asm-generic/barrier.h.

Change the asm-generic/barrier.h such that it allows partial barrier
definitions and fills out the rest with defaults.

There are a few architectures (m32r, m68k) that could probably
do away with their barrier.h file entirely but are kept for now due to
their unconventional nop() implementation.

https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=64741

Patch by Scott Graham <scottmg@chromium.org> on 2011-08-04
Reviewed by Adam Barth.

Source/WebCore:

Three different errors triggered by this test case. The case to
consider is a subdocument with an onunload on an element, that
destroys the parent document during the onunload. One fix was a
lifetime issue fixed by a protecting RefPtr, and another was an
additional cancel of event triggers. The main fix was that during the
transition to commited state, the documentLoader is being replaced by
the provisionalDocumentLoader. But, because during firing events in
the subdocument the parent is destroyed, that subevent caused the
provisionalDocumentLoader to be detached from its frame. By marking
the page as being in committed state before the parent documentLoader
is set, this is avoided.

 Fixed the usage of spatial data (and Point in specific) with 
 non-spatial indexes.
 Several problems :
   - The length of the Point class was not updated to include the 
     spatial reference system identifier. Fixed by increasing with 4 
     bytes.
   - The storage length of the spatial columns was not accounting for
     the length that is prepended to it. Fixed by treating the 
     spatial data columns as blobs (and thus increasing the storage
     length)
   - When creating the key image for comparison in index read wrong
     key image was created (the one needed for and r-tree search,
     not the one for b-tree/other search). Fixed by treating the
     spatial data columns as blobs (and creating the correct kind of
     image based on the index type).

Ever wondered why faces used for refs such as branch names have a
border?  It is because of this limitation mentioned in info node
`(elisp)Overlay Properties':

  Currently, all overlays take priority over text properties.
  Please avoid using negative priority values, as we have not
  yet decided just what they should mean.

So when a section is highlighted by changing the background (the
default), then all background colors things like reflabels that are
located inside the section loose their background color.  It seems
someone decided that just the foreground color being different from
surrounding text is not enough and also added a border to the faces
used for such things.  This has been reverted in some color themes
in others it has not.  After this change it is solely a matter of
taste, not visibility whether someone wants to keep the borders.

The borders will probably be removed from the defaults of these
faces eventually.  But this isn't urgent.

https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=89122

Reviewed by Martin Robinson.

Set the GStreamer pipeline to NULL instead of PAUSED on EOS. This
allows the audio-sink to release its connection to the audio
device. This is done only if the Media element is not
looping. To make the MediaPlayerPrivate layer aware of that
information the MediaPlayerClient interface was updated with a new
method mediaPlayerIsLooping, implemented by the HTMLMediaElement.

* html/HTMLMediaElement.cpp:
(WebCore::HTMLMediaElement::mediaPlayerIsLooping): Implementation of
MediaPlayerClient::mediaPlayerLoop, proxies to ::loop();
* html/HTMLMediaElement.h:
(HTMLMediaElement):
* platform/graphics/MediaPlayer.h:
(WebCore::MediaPlayerClient::mediaPlayerIsLooping): New method allowing
the MediaPlayer and its backend to know if a playback loop is
requested by the client.
* platform/graphics/gstreamer/MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer.cpp:
(WebCore::MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer::MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer):
(WebCore::MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer::playbackPosition): Report
seek time or media duration if EOS was reached. These early
returns are needed because the position query doesn't work on a
NULL pipeline.
(WebCore::MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer::changePipelineState):
Refactored to use an early return.
(WebCore::MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer::prepareToPlay): Reset the
seeking flag.
(WebCore::MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer::play): reset m_isEndReached.
(WebCore::MediaPlayerPrivateGStreamer::pause): Don't pause on EOS.

> offsets, and determines when to toggle the resizing of the renderer's view.
> 
> Currently all viewport updates are blocked while a gesture or scrolling is

> 
> This change updates the method to also perform the update if we've changed the
> resize state. Allowing the renderer to resize to account for the larger region
> when scrolling the controls away.
> 
> While this prevents showing older content, it only does so for normal speed
> scrolls. A quick flick can lead to such a rapid change in viewport, that we

bcm_enet_hw_preinit will correctly set values in ENET_CTL_REG for internal
or external MII operations, however, bcm_enet_open will blindly overwrite the
ENET_CTL_REG register value and thus we will loose any changes to it that
were made in bcm_enet_hw_preinit, rendering external MII operations non-working.

This would lead to the driver not being able to check for link availability on
external PHY setups, and thus we would never get to sending packets because
link was down from the driver side.

This was completely un-noticed because all boards out there but BCM6338-based
ones use internal phy on their enet0 interface.

OPM/ResInsight,200d5c65a39ba92d196ffb3ada42bebb0928c534,"AutoVcpkg: Include Vcpkg toolchain

Include the Vcpkg toolchain file after the installation of the first
package.

When building for the first time from a clean source tree, the Vcpkg
toolchain file does not exist. At the same time CMake is only reading
the toolchain file the very first time it is configuring, but since the
toolchain file is only created when vcpkg is configured on the first
call to vcpkg_install it will never read it. So it is not enough to just
reconfigure.

Note: It is not ideal to include it here since one might at some point
install and search for a package at an erlier point in the script and
fail to find it.

Alternative approaces that I considered:
- Include this file right after including AutoVcpkg. This would require
  1 recompilation for the file to be found and read which is
  unfortunate.
- Include this file in the config function in AutoVcpkg. This seemed
  difficult without including the file for every call to vcpkg_install,
  which seems unecessary.

KDE/kconfig,98c32e29f50465d4d4e16bafdf0491edbfb422b0,"WIP: Refactor KConfigXT

Summary:
The current KConfigXT compiler is in a sad state:
It's a massive file with loads of global variables that handle state, the generator is done within the main() function and it seems to have grown organically. There are no classes to separate logic / state / generation, what exists is code that generates code from a xml / ini pair, but it's hard to even discover what a bit of code is doing. The code istyle is C++ / Java from the nineties, which is not bad per see but it also uses quite a few things that are going to be deprecated in Qt 6 so I'm also taking the time make the code more streamlined with newer code style (no iterators, lambdas, auto usage, etc).

The code that generates the files simplly pushes strings to a text stream, and it's hard to figure out when something starts or something ends: for instance, the code that generates the Constructor has more than sixty lines of code englobing some nested if - for - if - for constructs.

Currently the code is ""done"" - there's one bug that I still need to find & fix regarding Translations, but the rest seems sane.
The current testcode generates incorrect *whitespaces* regarding the old code (there's some parts that I feel that it's important to fix before merging, but overall, the whitespace changes are not bad and easier to handle, old code had a hand-counted amount of spaces before each line, new code has a function whitespace() that adds the current-and-correct amount of whitespaces based on indentation level that you start by startScope() and ends with endScope(). rest of the code still needs to be ported to it.

I plan to fix the testcases whitespace by manually adding them, I'v fougth with the code for a while and added a few hacks there but I don't want to make the code hackish again.

New code is not perfect by any means, but is a good step in the right direction.

This code tries to Separate the compiler code into many different files / classes to be more obvious what's happening, and each class also has many helper methods to minimize copypaste.

  -     CodeGenerator: Has base code for the header and source files that can be shared
  -     HeaderGenerator: Logic for generating the header file
  -     SourceGenerator: Logic for generating the source file
  -     KcfgParser: Logic for parsing the kcfg file and extracting the information from the Xml file
  -     CommonStructs: a header that contains the structs that are currently used everywhere.
  -     KConfigParameters: (was CfgConfig - ConfigConfig, wat) - Has information passed via the kcfgc file
  -     kcfg_compiler - will be renamed to main - start the other classes and generates the files.

This code here currently has the begining of this separation, with the CodeGenerator and the HeaderGenerator in a ~good~ state, but unfinished.

Test Plan:
- Run the test cases,
- Compare the diffs generated by the testcases and fix in the code the errors / differences
- Run and compare real kde source with the new and old generators to look for errors
