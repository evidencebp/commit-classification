After a successful SRP login response we call scsi_unblock_requests() to
kick any pending IOs. The callback to process this SRP response happens in
a tasklet and therefore is in softirq context. The result of such is that
when blk-mq is enabled, it is no longer safe to call scsi_unblock_requests()
from this context. The result of duing so triggers the following WARN_ON
splat in dmesg after a host reset or CRQ reenablement.

SAP/openui5,7ae68781ae006604d1a00ceefa7c08dd037473dd,"[INTERNAL] sap.ui.documentation: Apply same excludes in .library and pom.xml

While the Maven based tooling applies excludes defined in either pom.xml
or .library files, UI5 Tooling only uses those defined in .library files.

In an effort to replace the Maven based tooling with UI5 Tooling, the
same excludes must be used.

For the Maven based tooling however, it might make sense to define
excludes in the pom.xml. Compared to .libary excludes, they are applied
earlier and prevent the Maven based tooling from analyzing the excluded
files. This can be necessary for cases where new JavaScript syntax is
used or other problems with the (legacy) Maven build tooling occur.

In order to keep the current setup working but to also apply the same
excludes for UI5 Tooling, they shall be defined in both places, pom.xml
and .library.

A separate change in sapui5.runtime has been crated to add a comment
to the pom.xml, indicating that the excludes need to be kept in sync:

Move the register slow register write and readback from out of the
critical path for execlists submission and delay it until the following
worker, shaving off around 200us. Note that the same signal_irq_work() is
allowed to run concurrently on each CPU (but it will only be queued once,
once running though it can be requeued and reexecuted) so we have to
remember to lock the global interactions as we cannot rely on the
signal_irq_work() itself providing the serialisation (in constrast to a
tasklet).

By pushing the arm/disarm into the central signaling worker we can close
the race for disarming the interrupt (and dropping its associated
GT wakeref) on parking the engine. If we loose the race, that GT wakeref
may be held indefinitely, preventing the machine from sleeping while
the GPU is ostensibly idle.

v2: Move the self-arming parking of the signal_irq_work to a flush of
the irq-work from intel_breadcrumbs_park().

tprrt/linux-stable,3b13758f51de30618d9c7f3fc174d8d1a3cb13cd,"cgroups: Allow dynamically changing net_classid

The classid of a process is changed either when a process is moved to
or from a cgroup or when the net_cls.classid file is updated.
Previously net_cls only supported propogating these changes to the
cgroup's related sockets when a process was added or removed from the
cgroup. This means it was neccessary to remove and re-add all processes
to a cgroup in order to update its classid. This change introduces
support for doing this dynamically - i.e. when the value is changed in
the net_cls_classid file, this will also trigger an update to the
classid associated with all sockets controlled by the cgroup.
This mimics the behaviour of other cgroup subsystems.
net_prio circumvents this issue by storing an index into a table with
each socket (and so any updates to the table, don't require updating
the value associated with the socket). net_cls, however, passes the
socket the classid directly, and so this additional step is needed.

We're going to be adding a few new barrier primitives, and in order to
avoid endless duplication make more agressive use of
asm-generic/barrier.h.

Change the asm-generic/barrier.h such that it allows partial barrier
definitions and fills out the rest with defaults.

There are a few architectures (m32r, m68k) that could probably
do away with their barrier.h file entirely but are kept for now due to
their unconventional nop() implementation.

https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=64741

Patch by Scott Graham <scottmg@chromium.org> on 2011-08-04
Reviewed by Adam Barth.

Source/WebCore:

Three different errors triggered by this test case. The case to
consider is a subdocument with an onunload on an element, that
destroys the parent document during the onunload. One fix was a
lifetime issue fixed by a protecting RefPtr, and another was an
additional cancel of event triggers. The main fix was that during the
transition to commited state, the documentLoader is being replaced by
the provisionalDocumentLoader. But, because during firing events in
the subdocument the parent is destroyed, that subevent caused the
provisionalDocumentLoader to be detached from its frame. By marking
the page as being in committed state before the parent documentLoader
is set, this is avoided.

 Fixed the usage of spatial data (and Point in specific) with 
 non-spatial indexes.
 Several problems :
   - The length of the Point class was not updated to include the 
     spatial reference system identifier. Fixed by increasing with 4 
     bytes.
   - The storage length of the spatial columns was not accounting for
     the length that is prepended to it. Fixed by treating the 
     spatial data columns as blobs (and thus increasing the storage
     length)
   - When creating the key image for comparison in index read wrong
     key image was created (the one needed for and r-tree search,
     not the one for b-tree/other search). Fixed by treating the
     spatial data columns as blobs (and creating the correct kind of
     image based on the index type).
