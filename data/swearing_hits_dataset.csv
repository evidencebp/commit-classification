This branch changes the way we do CSS cascading, which has many
implications.

After the SVG tree of nodes/elements has been loaded, we traverse the
tree and do a CSS cascade.  Each Node has a ComputedValues inside it,
which contains the result of its cascade.

The State struct is just a small remnant now: it only holds each
node's SpecifiedValues (e.g. as specified in the SVG file), and some
information which should really go in the Node, not in the State -
important_styles and the results of cond evaluation.

The drawing_ctx no longer has a State!  This used to carry around the
current cascade, and that state.affine had the current affine.  At the
very bottom of the drawing process, we would cr.set_matrix(that_affine)
and draw.

But now, the drawing_ctx->cr has the running affine.  The code has to
be careful to maintain it accurate.  This is a bit horrible right now,
but we will refactor it gradually to make this foolproof.

Normally a node would be able to use its own node.values (the
ComputedValues) to get the cascade it needs... except the <use>
element causes the referenced element to use the <use>'s own cascade,
not the referenced element's original cascade.  So, we introduce
CascadedValues, an enum that can resolve itself to a node's normal
cascade or the derived one from <use>, as needed.

All calls to make_property!() have been audited so that ther
inherits_automatically is correct as per the spec.

There's a new, ignored test - ignore-masking-path-07-b.svg.  It fails
if run; that's because we don't handle clip paths with unions.  We
will have to do another big refactor to solve this.

None of this code wants to resize clients. Thus, it makes sense to only set the
position of a client and ignore its size.

Also, this sneaks in a fix for no_offscreen which is documented to return the
client's new position, but didn't actually do so.

this is necessary to act as an intermediary between PVG and
the delta V stats in MJ.  it offers objects which are themselves
static that correspond to logical rocket stages even though
the ksp stage and the position in the stage stats may bounce
around as the user drags the staging crap all over the place.
of course the stats referenced by the object may change, but
the first stage of the rocket is always a given object and it
gets marked as 'staged' when it gets dropped and then the
stage manager tracks how many of those significant stages have
been dropped so we always know 'which' numbered stage we are
on and a sort of trusted 'what rocket stage number is this'.

the fact that i've spent like 1.5 years working on this and
think i may have finally more or less nailed the design of what
we really need indicates how bad of a rocket simulator KSP is.

At the moment, Wagtail redirects all requests (including AJAX) to the

lead to the login page being nested in a component somewhere (which
looks horrible).

This changes the behaviour so requests that come from AJAX are given a

handle the issue properly.

* treat accumulator keys as mostly-read-only

* pushed acc down to send_and_maybe_buffer_stanza, returned to top-level handlers; now we can start removing mod_amp hacks

* pass xmlel along with the acc to process_packet - removed nearly all usages of 'to_send', hope to get rid of it altogether; also improved naming somewhat

* inter-process broadcasting rewritten; and, no more to_send stuff

* cleanup and Elvis-compliance of part of s2s_in

* initialise accumulator upon stanza entering s2s

* for elvis

* bugfixes

* rewrote wait_for_session_or_sm to use acc

* got rid if mongoose_acc:initialise and mongoose_acc:terminate

* redundant helper

* rewrote wait_for_auth to squash bug in wait_for_sessio_or_sm

* Reworked handling routed broadcast

* fixed a horrible bug in acc:from_element

* started rewriting iq-handlers

* route_iq, by mod_ping and mod_caps

* added Acc to iq handler API

* elvis-compliance and some bugfixes

* add an API for setting persistent properties on accumulator (such that are not stripped when shipping acc to another process)

* add preprocessing hook to facilitate customisation (like tweaking stanza or filling acc with extra data)

* upgraded mod_offline

* first end-to-end test of accumulators

* updated docs, some style fixes

* changes as requestd

* [skip ci] linguistical improvements

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

### The problem in current block matrix mulitiplication

As in JIRA https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-18218 described, block matrix multiplication in spark may cause some problem, suppose we have `M*N` dimensions matrix A multiply `N*P` dimensions matrix B, when N is much larger than M and P, then the following problem may occur:
- when the middle dimension N is too large, it will cause reducer OOM.
- even if OOM do not occur, it will still cause parallism too low.
- when N is much large than M and P, and matrix A and B have many partitions, it may cause too many partition on M and P dimension, it will cause much larger shuffled data size. (I will expain this in detail in the following.)

### Key point of my improvement

In this PR, I introduce `midDimSplitNum` parameter, and improve the algorithm, to resolve this problem.

In order to understand the improvement in this PR, first let me give a simple case to explain how the current mulitiplication works and what cause the problems above:

suppose we have block matrix A, contains 200 blocks (`2 numRowBlocks * 100 numColBlocks`), blocks arranged in 2 rows, 100 cols:
```
A00 A01 A02 ... A0,99
A10 A11 A12 ... A1,99
```
and we have block matrix B, also contains 200 blocks (`100 numRowBlocks * 2 numColBlocks`), blocks arranged in 100 rows, 2 cols:
```
B00    B01
B10    B11
B20    B21
...
B99,0  B99,1
```
Suppose all blocks in the two matrices are dense for now.
Now we call A.multiply(B), suppose the generated `resultPartitioner` contains 2 rowPartitions and 2 colPartitions (can't be more partitions because the result matrix only contains `2 * 2` blocks), the current algorithm will contains two shuffle steps:

**step-1**
Step-1 will generate 4 reducer, I tag them as reducer-00, reducer-01, reducer-10, reducer-11, and shuffle data as following:
```
A00 A01 A02 ... A0,99
B00 B10 B20 ... B99,0    shuffled into reducer-00

A00 A01 A02 ... A0,99
B01 B11 B21 ... B99,1    shuffled into reducer-01

A10 A11 A12 ... A1,99
B00 B10 B20 ... B99,0    shuffled into reducer-10

A10 A11 A12 ... A1,99
B01 B11 B21 ... B99,1    shuffled into reducer-11
```

and the shuffling above is a `cogroup` transform, note that each reducer contains **only one group**.

**step-2**
Step-2 will do an `aggregateByKey` transform on the result of step-1, will also generate 4 reducers, and generate the final result RDD, contains 4 partitions, each partition contains one block.

The main problems are in step-1. Now we have only 4 reducers, but matrix A and B have 400 blocks in total, obviously the reducer number is too small.
and, we can see that, each reducer contains only one group(the group concept in `coGroup` transform), each group contains 200 blocks. This is terrible because we know that `coGroup` transformer will load each group into memory when computing. It is un-extensable in the algorithm level. Suppose matrix A has 10000 cols blocks or more instead of 100? Than each reducer will load 20000 blocks into memory. It will easily cause reducer OOM.

This PR try to resolve the problem described above.
When matrix A with dimension M * N multiply matrix B with dimension N * P, the middle dimension N is the keypoint. If N is large, the current mulitiplication implementation works badly.
In this PR, I introduce a `numMidDimSplits` parameter, represent how many splits it will cut on the middle dimension N.
Still using the example described above, now we set `numMidDimSplits = 10`, now we can generate 40 reducers in **step-1**:

the reducer-ij above now will be splited into 10 reducers: reducer-ij0, reducer-ij1, ... reducer-ij9, each reducer will receive 20 blocks.
now the shuffle works as following:

**reducer-000 to reducer-009**
```
A0,0 A0,10 A0,20 ... A0,90
B0,0 B10,0 B20,0 ... B90,0    shuffled into reducer-000

A0,1 A0,11 A0,21 ... A0,91
B1,0 B11,0 B21,0 ... B91,0    shuffled into reducer-001

A0,2 A0,12 A0,22 ... A0,92
B2,0 B12,0 B22,0 ... B92,0    shuffled into reducer-002

...

A0,9 A0,19 A0,29 ... A0,99
B9,0 B19,0 B29,0 ... B99,0    shuffled into reducer-009
```

**reducer-010 to reducer-019**
```
A0,0 A0,10 A0,20 ... A0,90
B0,1 B10,1 B20,1 ... B90,1    shuffled into reducer-010

A0,1 A0,11 A0,21 ... A0,91
B1,1 B11,1 B21,1 ... B91,1    shuffled into reducer-011

A0,2 A0,12 A0,22 ... A0,92
B2,1 B12,1 B22,1 ... B92,1    shuffled into reducer-012

...

A0,9 A0,19 A0,29 ... A0,99
B9,1 B19,1 B29,1 ... B99,1    shuffled into reducer-019
```

**reducer-100 to reducer-109** and **reducer-110 to reducer-119** is similar to the above, I omit to write them out.

### API for this optimized algorithm

I add a new API as following:
```
  def multiply(
      other: BlockMatrix,
      numMidDimSplits: Int // middle dimension split number, expained above
): BlockMatrix
```

### Shuffled data size analysis (compared under the same parallelism)

The optimization has some subtle influence on the total shuffled data size. Appropriate `numMidDimSplits` will significantly reduce the shuffled data size,
but too large `numMidDimSplits` may increase the shuffled data in reverse. For now I don't want to introduce formula to make thing too complex, I only use a simple case to represent it here:

Suppose we have two same size square matrices X and Y, both have `16 numRowBlocks * 16 numColBlocks`. X and Y are both dense matrix. Now let me analysis the shuffling data size in the following case:

**case 1: X and Y both partitioned in 16 rowPartitions and 16 colPartitions, numMidDimSplits = 1**
ShufflingDataSize = (16 * 16 * (16 + 16) + 16 * 16) blocks = 8448 blocks
parallelism = 16 * 16 * 1 = 256 //use step-1 reducers number as the parallism because it cost most of the computation time in this algorithm.

**case 2: X and Y both partitioned in 8 rowPartitions and 8 colPartitions, numMidDimSplits = 4**
ShufflingDataSize = (8 * 8 * (32 + 32) + 16 * 16 * 4) blocks = 5120 blocks
parallelism = 8 * 8 * 4 = 256 //use step-1 reducers number as the parallism because it cost most of the computation time in this algorithm.

**The two cases above all have parallism = 256**, case 1 `numMidDimSplits = 1` is equivalent with current implementation in mllib, but case 2 shuffling data is 60.6% of case 1, **it shows that under the same parallelism, proper `numMidDimSplits` will significantly reduce the shuffling data size**.

## How was this patch tested?

This system separates parsing from model creation, so should be much easier to test with offline tests. The new model is less forgiving of incorrect data being passed around, throwing more exceptions if you're not using it right (like string years). The new system also is a bit more organized about how parameters are passed in, always taking 'year' first, if it's a required param, for example.

Next up will be moving the other datafeeds over to this model, building their tests, then fixing the terrible Controllers and routing that is the Datafeed system.

we default to Nickel's locale on fresh installs?

The new functions are:

  now_as_string: I could split it in two but for now it is good enough.
  I was going to allow formatting any timestamp, but then I found
  (again!) that Skylark doesn't support Long.

  read_path: Read a path from the checkout dir

  write_path: Write an arbitrary string to a path in the checkout dir.

Yes, this opens the door to a lot of awful transformations, but OTOH
it is in the Skylark transformation code. Also, nothing that they
cannot do with core.copy + core.replace (Except less hacky). These
kind of tranformations are not mean to be reversable.

Example usage:

  def test(ctx):
      path = ctx.new_path('folder/file.txt')
      ctx.read_path(path)
      ctx.write_path(path, ctx.read_path(path) + ctx.now_as_string())

This only applies to the SH4 registers, not any of the other components.

This is needed because it was fucking with the SCIF and causing it to send
garbage data during initialization because the write handlers thought the
software was using it to transmit data over serial.  In general, using the
write handlers for initialization was a bad idea due to registers like this
that have side-effects.

The modules side of r299226, which serializes #pragma pack state,
doesn't work well.

The main purpose was to make -include and -include-pch match semantics
(the PCH side).  We also started serializing #pragma pack in PCMs, in
the hopes of making modules and non-modules builds more consistent.  But
consider:

    $ cat a.h
    $ cat b.h
    #pragma pack(push, 2)
    $ cat module.modulemap
    module M {
        module a { header ""a.h"" }
        module b { header ""b.h"" }
    }
    $ cat t.cpp
    #include ""a.h""
    #pragma pack(show)

As of r299226, the #pragma pack(show) gives ""2"", even though we've only
included ""a.h"".

- With -fmodules-local-submodule-visibility, this is clearly wrong.  We
  should get the default state (8 on x86_64).

- Without -fmodules-local-submodule-visibility, this kind of matches how
  other things work (as if include-the-whole-module), but it's still
  really terrible, and it doesn't actually make modules and non-modules
  builds more consistent.

This commit disables the serialization for modules, essentially a
partial revert of r299226.

Going forward:

 1. Having this #pragma pack stuff escape is terrible design (or, more
    often, a horrible bug).  We should prioritize adding warnings (maybe
    -Werror by default?).

 2. If we eventually reintroduce this for modules, it should only apply
    to -fmodules-local-submodule-visibility, and it should be tracked on
    a per-submodule basis.

I have pinnacle hardware now. None of this pinnacle-specific crap is at
all necessary (in fact, some of it needed to be removed to actually make
it work). The only thing unique about this device is that it often
transfers inbound data w/a header of 0x90, meaning 16 bytes of IR data
following it, so I had to make adjustments for that, and now its working
perfectly fine.

When using Docker and especially on Mac OS X, performances are terrible when using a ""mount"" on the host inside the container. (which happens by default)

To optimize the performances, one of the tricks is to change where the application is going to write the cache and the logs.

This PR provides a new env variables `APP_CACHE_DIR` and `APP_LOG_DIR` which can be set to change where will be saved the caches and the logs.

I know we can do it per project BUT:
- I think that is a good addition to Symfony
- it would allow project like eZ Platform and eZ Launchpad to automate that optimization

[Kudos to dhowells for tracking that crap down]

If two processes attempt to cause automounting on the same mountpoint at the
same time, the vfsmount holding the mountpoint will be left with one too few
references on it, causing a BUG when the kernel tries to clean up.

The problem is that lock_mount() drops the caller's reference to the
mountpoint's vfsmount in the case where it finds something already mounted on
the mountpoint as it transits to the mounted filesystem and replaces path->mnt
with the new mountpoint vfsmount.

During a pathwalk, however, we don't take a reference on the vfsmount if it is
the same as the one in the nameidata struct, but do_add_mount() doesn't know
this.

The fix is to make sure we have a ref on the vfsmount of the mountpoint before
calling do_add_mount().  However, if lock_mount() doesn't transit, we're then
left with an extra ref on the mountpoint vfsmount which needs releasing.
We can handle that in follow_managed() by not making assumptions about what
we can and what we cannot get from lookup_mnt() as the current code does.

The callers of follow_managed() expect that reference to path->mnt will be
grabbed iff path->mnt has been changed.  follow_managed() and follow_automount()
keep track of whether such reference has been grabbed and assume that it'll
happen in those and only those cases that'll have us return with changed
path->mnt.  That assumption is almost correct - it breaks in case of
racing automounts and in even harder to hit race between following a mountpoint
and a couple of mount --move.  The thing is, we don't need to make that
assumption at all - after the end of loop in follow_manage() we can check
if path->mnt has ended up unchanged and do mntput() if needed.

The BUG can be reproduced with the following test program:

	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <sys/types.h>
	#include <sys/stat.h>
	#include <unistd.h>
	#include <sys/wait.h>
	int main(int argc, char **argv)
	{
		int pid, ws;
		struct stat buf;
		pid = fork();
		stat(argv[1], &buf);
		if (pid > 0) wait(&ws);
		return 0;
	}

and the following procedure:

 (1) Mount an NFS volume that on the server has something else mounted on a
     subdirectory.  For instance, I can mount / from my server:

	mount warthog:/ /mnt -t nfs4 -r

     On the server /data has another filesystem mounted on it, so NFS will see
     a change in FSID as it walks down the path, and will mark /mnt/data as
     being a mountpoint.  This will cause the automount code to be triggered.

     !!! Do not look inside the mounted fs at this point !!!

 (2) Run the above program on a file within the submount to generate two
     simultaneous automount requests:

	/tmp/forkstat /mnt/data/testfile

 (3) Unmount the automounted submount:

	umount /mnt/data

 (4) Unmount the original mount:

	umount /mnt

     At this point the kernel should throw a BUG with something like the
     following:

	BUG: Dentry ffff880032e3c5c0{i=2,n=} still in use (1) [unmount of nfs4 0:12]

Note that the bug appears on the root dentry of the original mount, not the
mountpoint and not the submount because sys_umount() hasn't got to its final
mntput_no_expire() yet, but this isn't so obvious from the call trace:

 [<ffffffff8117cd82>] shrink_dcache_for_umount+0x69/0x82

 [<ffffffff8109e1ca>] ? trace_hardirqs_on_caller+0x1fd/0x22f
 [<ffffffff816ea86b>] system_call_fastpath+0x16/0x1b

as do_umount() is inlined.  However, you can see release_mounts() in there.

Note also that it may be necessary to have multiple CPU cores to be able to
trigger this bug.

Summary:
This diff enables building the eden watcher by linking in thrift and
its various dependencies.

To support building in-fbsource and in the github repo, a `maybe_shipit_dir`
function is used to setup a symlink to the `eden` and `fboss/common` dirs (this
mirrors the shipit configuration for this project: we cannot simply run shipit
because we have to build on mac and windows and shipit requires Hack, and that
does not support those platforms).

I tried to persuade cmake to let me build this without the use of a symlink but
found it too difficult to teach everything about the path mapping.  The
symlinks aren't terrible, but are the reason why this diff also updates some
`.gitinore` files that are seemingly unrelated to this diff.

This diff changes a couple of build/link options: without them the end product
fails to link either due to implicit/unilateral enablement of UBSAN in some of
the deps, or because warning->error promotion is turned on.

This diff includes a copy of the `ThriftCppLibrary.cmake` file from the fboss
repo.  This should get centralized and shipit'ed out into the places that
consume it.  That can be done when someone gets around to doing the same for
the `FindGlog.cmake` file and doesn't need to hold up this diff.

tl;dr: This PR speedups dolphin on mobiles with the Mali GPU and ES 3.2
drivers by a factor of 10 by using the method with the biggest overhead.
Please keep care not to buy this shit!

The ARM driver team seems to care very well about their customers. But
bad luck, users and open source developers are *not* their customers. So
even device-independent feature requests are just ignored for *years*:

https://community.arm.com/graphics/f/discussions/4645/gl_ext_buffer_storage-support

The bad point, they neither implement any of the other common ways to
stream dynamic content in unextented GL:
- They just ignore the GL_MAP_UNSYNCHRONIZED_BIT flag
- They don't support on-device buffer updates and just stall with
glBufferSubData

It seems like no benchmark is using any dynamic content - and like no
customer cares about anything but benchmarks, or users...

We have a flag to disable the glBufferSubData way, this PR adds the flag
to also disable the unsychronized mapping way. The second one is
available since their ES 3.2 update, but slow as hell.

So how to continue? The last remaining technical way to stream dynamic
content at all is to alloc a new buffer per draw call with glBufferData.
This is very gross, but still a factor 10 speedup compared to stalling
the GPU. Small tests shows that you can expect another 3-5 times speedup
with EXT_buffer_data, so Mali would be on pair with Adreno here. So if
you have bought such a device unfortunately, please try to make noise on
your vendor forums/support and ask for this extension. If you are going
to buy a new mobile, I'd recormend to avoid *any* mobile with a Mali GPU
in it.

This adds a field terraform_version to the state that represents the
Terraform version that wrote that state. If Terraform encounters a state
written by a future version, it will error. You must use at least the
version that wrote that state.

Internally we have fields to override this behavior (StateFutureAllowed),
but I chose not to expose them as CLI flags, since the user can just
modify the state directly. This is tricky, but should be tricky to
represent the horrible disaster that can happen by enabling it.

We didn't have to bump the state format version since the absense of the
field means it was written by version ""0.0.0"" which will always be
older. In effect though this change will always apply to version 2 of
the state since it appears in 0.7 which bumped the version for other
purposes.

About The Pull Request

Fixes the sm producing fusion.
dynamic_heat_modifier and power_transmission_bonus never got a clean reset, and because they are global vars, kept gaining value. I've fixed this and tweaked 1 comment about max heat output.
This was a result of misunderstanding from both ghil and ninja, and is now thankfully fixed.
Why It's Good For The Game

This shit is neat, should actually be in the game rather then in my fixing pile.

It's a terrible thing to hold dev in iptables target. When the dev is
being removed, unregister_netdevice has to wait for the dev to become
free. dmesg will keep logging the err:

  kernel:unregister_netdevice: waiting for veth0_in to become free. \
  Usage count = 1

until iptables rules with this target are removed manually.

The worse thing is when deleting a netns, a virtual nic will be deleted
instead of reset to init_net in default_device_ops exit/exit_batch. As
it is earlier than to flush the iptables rules in iptable_filter_net_ops
exit, unregister_netdevice will block to wait for the nic to become free.

As unregister_netdevice is actually waiting for iptables rules flushing
while iptables rules have to be flushed after unregister_netdevice. This
'dead lock' will cause unregister_netdevice to block there forever. As
the netns is not available to operate at that moment, iptables rules can
not even be flushed manually either.

The reproducer can be:

  # ip netns add test
  # ip link add veth0_in type veth peer name veth0_out
  # ip link set veth0_in netns test
  # ip netns exec test ip link set lo up
  # ip netns exec test ip link set veth0_in up
  # ip netns exec test iptables -I INPUT -d 1.2.3.4 -i veth0_in -j \
    CLUSTERIP --new --clustermac 89:d4:47:eb:9a:fa --total-nodes 3 \
    --local-node 1 --hashmode sourceip-sourceport
  # ip netns del test

This issue can be triggered by all virtual nics with ipt_CLUSTERIP.

This patch is to fix it by not holding dev in ipt_CLUSTERIP, but saving
the dev->ifindex instead of the dev.

As Pablo Neira Ayuso's suggestion, it will refresh c->ifindex and dev's
mc by registering a netdevice notifier, just as what xt_TEE does. So it
removes the old codes updating dev's mc, and also no need to initialize
c->ifindex with dev->ifindex.

But as one config can be shared by more than one targets, and the netdev
notifier is per config, not per target. It couldn't get e->ip.iniface
in the notifier handler. So e->ip.iniface has to be saved into config.

Note that for backwards compatibility, this patch doesn't remove the
codes checking if the dev exists before creating a config.

v1->v2:
  - As Pablo Neira Ayuso's suggestion, register a netdevice notifier to
    manage c->ifindex and dev's mc.

Third set of fixes for IIO in the 3.13 cycle.

* Fix for a bug in the new cm36651 driver where it told the IIO driver it
  was providing a decimal part, but then didn't.  Now it correctly tells the
  IIO core that it is only providing an integer value.  This prevents random
  incorrect values being output on a sysfs read.

* 3 fixes where drivers were miss specifying the endianness of their channels
  as output through the buffer interface.  These were discovered whilst
  removing the terrible IIO_ST macro once and for all.  The result is that
  userspace may be informed that the buffer elements are being output as
  little endian (on little endian platforms) when infact they are big endian.
  Thus userspace will handle them incorrectly.  This incorrect buffer
  element specification is provided as sysfs attributes under
  iio:deviceN/scan_elements.

All of the change list pages have been rewritten in terms of the
new query operator implementation.  If the query exactly matches
a particular navigation call, we use the same underlying function
to scan the database, which gives us about the same performance.

Rather than showing custom page titles, all of the change list pages
update the search bar and show the underlying query.  This helps
users to learn what search operators Gerrit supports internally.

If the query has additional filter restrictions, we try to pick a
reasonable scan function to read from the database, but then use
filters inside of the JVM to whack out rows that do not match.
The scan function selection is based on a hand-coded cost based
query rewriter, which is really more of a rule based optimizer than
it is a cost based optimizer.  Its rather horrible at picking a good
""query plan"", but its good enough given the limitations of the gwtorm
access API that we can still do something reasonable for the user.

Because the query graph is stored in memory as a proper graph,
we may be able to later perform some optimization work where we
transform the graph into a proper SQL SELECT statement and hand
it off to the database server for execution.  For most SQL systems
this would outperform what we do now.

Because the query rewriter edits the query, it may produce an invalid
result sometimes.  Any old hand-coded search is correct, because the
rewriter just transforms to the same underlying function that we used
to have.  More complex filters may still uncover bugs in the rewiter.

Some queries are simply not executable.  For example, ""is:reviewed""
won't execute, because we don't have a way to scan the database
along that dimension.  The access method doesn't exist simply
because the result set would be too large to reasonably process.

The set of operators is still not complete.  We should support
things like 'age:3d' to mean changes that were last modified more
than 3 days ago, but we don't yet.  Doing so efficiently probably
requires converting the age specification into a sortKey and using
an existing scan operation along that column.

Queries once parsed into a predicate tree can be tested against a
single ChangeData object, to consider just that one change.  This
will later be useful for more powerful project watch specifications,
or access control rules.

Updating user avatar icon to overhauled standard WikimediaUI icon.
Also:
- change `line-height` of personal menu to `14px` for better positioning
  and introducing corresponding LESS variables
- slightly increase user avatar icon to be on par with ULS one
- putting avatar icon within link on active user, an awful user experience
  that has long bugged me.

A bug in GetMarcBiblio can cause severe data loss if your database has
records where the biblionumber and biblioitemnumber do not match and the
script misc/batchRebuildBiblioTables.pl is run.

The Biblio::GetMarcBiblio makes a kall to
C4::Biblio::_koha_marc_update_bib_ids which passes the biblionumber as
both the biblionumber *and the biblioitemnumber*.

Thus, if your biblio and biblioitem numbers are not always equal, you
will end up with a record where the biblioitemnumber is incorrect in the
record!

This is usually not a severe issue, but since batchRebuildBiblioTables
uses that record to update the database tables, it ends up updating the
wrong biblioitem row!

NOTE: What a horrible, horrible typo that was. Tested this with the
      second patch.

If the driver were to happen to have a mutex held while
the i40e_init_adminq call was called, the init_adminq might
inadvertently call mutex_init on a lock that was held
which is a violation of the calling semantics.

Fix this by avoiding adminq.c code allocating/freeing this memory, and
then do the same work only once in probe/remove.

Testing Hints (Required if no HSD): for VF, load i40evf in bare metal
and echo 32 > sriov_numvfs; echo 0 > sriov_numvfs in a loop.  Yes this
is a horrible thing to do.

these DAG combines.

The DAG auto-CSE thing is truly terrible. Due to it, when RAUW-ing
a node with its operand, you can cause its uses to CSE to itself, which
then causes their uses to become your uses which causes them to be
picked up by the RAUW. For nodes that are determined to be ""no-ops"",
this is ""fine"". But if the RAUW is one of several steps to enact
a transformation, this causes the DAG to really silently eat an discard
nodes that you would never expect. It took days for me to actually
pinpoint a test case triggering this and a really frustrating amount of
time to even comprehend the bug because I never even thought about the
ability of RAUW to iteratively consume nodes due to CSE-ing them into
itself.

To fix this, we have to build up a brand-new chain of operations any
time we are combining across (potentially) intervening nodes. But once
the logic is added to do this, another issue surfaces: CombineTo eagerly
deletes the one node combined, *but no others*. This is... really
frustrating. If deleting it makes its operands become dead, those
operand nodes often won't go onto the worklist in the
order you would want -- they're already on it and not near the top. That
means things higher on the worklist will get combined prior to these
dead nodes being GCed out of the worklist, and if the chain is long, the
immediate users won't be enough to re-detect where the root of the chain
is that became single-use again after deleting the dead nodes. The
better way to do this is to never immediately delete nodes, and instead
to just enqueue them so we can recursively delete them. The
combined-from node is typically not on the worklist anyways by virtue of
having been popped off.... But that in turn breaks other tests that
*require* CombineTo to delete unused nodes. :: sigh ::

Fortunately, there is a better way. This whole routine should have been
returning the replacement rather than using CombineTo which is quite
hacky. Switch to that, and all the pieces fall together.

I suspect the same kind of miscompile is possible in the half-shuffle
folding code, and potentially the recursive folding code. I'll be
switching those over to a pattern more like this one for safety's sake
even though I don't immediately have any test cases for them. Note that
the only way I got a test case for this instance was with *heavily* DAG
combined 256-bit shuffle sequences generated by my fuzzer. ;]

@andrew, this seems to be what was causing backwards slicing to fail.

tweak: You now have to be naked to get the nice shower moodlet, if you shower with clothes you get a bad moodie
add: Hygiene, you slowly become dirty over time, the more covered in blood you are the faster you will lose hygiene. When you are too dirty you will have a stink overlay. (Hygiene doesn't affect mood currently) It also spawns miasma slowly if you smell like shit.
add: adds NEET and neat traits. NEET's get 20 bucks social welfare extra and like being unhygienic, while neat people dislike being unhygienic and like being hygienic
/cl

This doesn't affect mood so plssss dont strawman in this PR about how I'm forcing you to shower or die or whatever

This PR is mostly visual and will allow for people to judge others for literaly being smelly as hell.

The libdivecomputer interfaces are pure crap.  There are no generic
""open the dive computer"" or ""create a parser for the dive computer""
interfaces, instead each dive computer you support has its own open and
parser generator interface.

And they change.  Happily fairly seldom, but they change.  And two days
ago, Jef changed the interface for the Mares Icon HD computer in order
to support the newer HD Net Ready variant.

I've asked Jef to make a sane interface for ""open the dive computer"" and
""just create the parser"" for libdivecomputer, but he claims that he
cannot just track the device model details internally.  Which is
obviously a completely bogus claim, since the way *we* track the model
details is to just feed it back from the silly event.

libdivecomputer should just do that internally and not bother us with
its crazy internal model numbers.  But whatever.

In the meantime, work around this braindamage, and hope that
libdivecomputer comes to its senses some day.

This is a terrible hack, and it's not how we want to implement things
in 3.12, but it's enough to have the same keyboard layout in the

on the fate of the keyboard g-s-d plugin.

even when caching its cache directory, it's quite slow. I have a feeling
that there's something more that needs to be done to have poetry's
caching work as quickly as it does locally.

I'm also moving to codecov, since coveralls has lousy support for
combining coverage reports from parallelized jobs, and even worse
support combining coverage support from differing languages.
Codecov advertises this as a first-class feature.

Because `coveralls` couldn't support `coverage` v5, we can now upgrade!

Summary:In f2aa5b0e78c2f5 (D3095672) we tightened up mutation config validation a little too much, breaking product code that didn't explicitly include the connection field in the fat query definition.

In this commit we make it a little less aggressive:

- If the connection field is explicit in the fat query, we validate it.
- If it is not explicit but we can get it by intersecting with a tracked query, we validate that.
- Otherwise we let things slide and give up.

Note that in doing this I addressed the TODO comment and moved the code that deals with fields on the fat parent outside the conditional, so that it runs even when we don't have any tracked queries. That TODO predates even the open source release of Relay, so if somebody has context on if this is a terrible idea, please let me know.

Add protobuf stuff for HostStatus

From high-priority to low-priority:

 * Add `HostStatus` protobuf specification
 * Have `pkg/api/ambassador/` get `.UnmarshalJSON()` methods that do the right thing (even if the way we get them to do the right thing is hacky).
 * Add `Host` protobuf specification
 * Have `make generate` work properly even if `$(OSS_HOME)` != `$(CURDIR)`
 * Revive the `Makefile` bits to generate `pkg/api/envoy/`, since I wanted to use some of those bits for `pkg/api/ambassador/` (but not the bits to generate `api/envoy/`, or the other Envoy build stuff)
 * Upgrade protoc 3.5.1→3.8.0

The low-priority stuff is done as supporting changes to the high-priority stuff.

----

A slightly abridged Slack conversation, so that more than just Flynn and I can see it:

<flynn> OK, I don’t really understand #1999 — what’s the `nojson` bit?
<lukeshu> things in most `.proto` get a `.UnmarshalJSON()` method in their generated Go.  I arranged it so that things defined in `*_nojson.proto` don't get a generated `.UnmarshalJSON()`.
<lukeshu> why do I want Host to not get a generated `.UnamrshalJSON()?`
<lukeshu> A `Host` contains 3 things:
<lukeshu> - metadata
<lukeshu> - spec
<lukeshu> - status
<lukeshu> The generated `.UnmarshalJSON()` calls out to `protobuf/jsonpb`, so that an ordinary call to `encoding/json.Unmarshal` will call `→ obj.UnmarshalJSON() → jsonpb.Unmarshal()`, and it will do the ""right thing"" if you use the standard `encoding/json` instead of using `protobuf/jsonpb`.
<lukeshu> Where ""right thing"" means ""the thing specified by proto3""
<lukeshu> But k8s.io uses proto2.  And proto2 didn't have a Timestamp primitive, so Kubernetes invented the hack that is https://godoc.org/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1#Time
<lukeshu> And protobuf/jsonpb chockes on metav1.Time
<lukeshu> Now, doing ""the thing specified by proto3"" is actually really important for Enums, because the default `encoding/json` thing won't work for them at all.
<flynn> :face_vomiting:
<lukeshu> But k8s.io enums don't actually get emitted as protobuf enums. Additionally, they have defined all of the appropriate UnmarshalJSON methods such that `encoding/json` already does the right thing for them.
<lukeshu> So, in our `Host`, we want to call `encoding/json` for the `metadata`, but `protobuf/jsonpb` for `spec` and `status`.  We don't particularly care which is called for the `Host` itself.
<flynn> That’s… disgusting.
<lukeshu> So, call `encoding/json` for the `Host` itself (i.e. don't generate a `.UnmarshalJSON()` for it), but then do generate `.UnmarshalJSON()` methods for `HostSpec` and `HostStatus` that will have `encoding/json` call in to `protobuf/jsonpb`.
<lukeshu> And this works because the types that we generate `.UnmarshalJSON()` for don't contain any problematic k8s.io types.
<lukeshu> So I guess the shorter form of the answer is:
<lukeshu>  - broadly: ""We need to avoid generating `.UnmarshalJSON()` methods for anything that makes use of a problematic k8s.io type; we do this by putting it in a `*_nojson.proto` file.""
<lukeshu>  - specifically: ""`Host` contains k8s.io meta/v1.ObjectMeta, and ObjectMeta contains meta/v1.Time, and meta/v1.Time is problematic""

<flynn> Mostly I worry about fragility…
<lukeshu> Yeah, the situation with k8s.io protobuf is fragile, but I'm not sure what a better route would be.
<lukeshu> I think a decent rule of thumb is
<lukeshu> - `ambassador.Thing` goes in a `_nojson.proto`
<lukeshu> - `ambassador.Thing` only contains `k8s.TypeMeta`, `k8s.ObjectMeta`, `ambassador.ThingSpec`, and possibly `ambassador.ThingStatus`
<lukeshu> - `ambassador.ThingSpec` and `ambassador.ThingStatus` go in a `.proto`
<lukeshu> - `ambassador.ThingSpec` and `ambassador.ThingStatus` cannot use any k8s type that includes `k8s.Time`, `k8s.Duration`, or other types that are problematic
<lukeshu> (and hope beyond all hope that we never want to use a k8s type that happens to include `k8s.Time`)

<lukeshu> I think all of the root problematic types are
<lukeshu> 
<lukeshu>     $ cd ~/src/github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/staging/src/k8s.io && git grep ') UnmarshalJSON(' ':!*_test.go' |grep /v|sed -r 's,(.*)/[^/]*:func \(\S* (\S*)\) UnmarshalJSON.*,k8s.io/\1.\2,'
<lukeshu>     k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/apis/apiextensions/v1.*JSONSchemaPropsOrBool
<lukeshu>     k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/apis/apiextensions/v1.*JSONSchemaPropsOrStringArray

<lukeshu>     k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/apis/apiextensions/v1beta1.*JSONSchemaPropsOrStringArray
<lukeshu>     k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/apis/apiextensions/v1beta1.*JSONSchemaPropsOrArray
<lukeshu>     k8s.io/apiextensions-apiserver/pkg/apis/apiextensions/v1beta1.*JSON
<lukeshu>     k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1.*Duration
<lukeshu>     k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1.*GroupVersion
<lukeshu>     k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1.*FieldsV1

<lukeshu>     k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1/unstructured.*UnstructuredList

<flynn> We could stop using the K8s types inside Host entirely.
<flynn> (Not sure that’s better, just brainstorming.)
<lukeshu> So the alternative is to just not specify `Host` in protobuf, and write the struct definition in Go.
<lukeshu> (1) That Go would be identical to the `protoc` output now
<lukeshu> (2) We'd still have to be careful to avoid the wrong k8s types in the rest of our protobuf specs.
<lukeshu> So I'm not sure that it's better, and that it's just less... obvious that the whole thing is fragile.

  * move rid allocation into IDMAP.  See comments in _api_samr_create_user()
  * add winbind delete user/group functions

I'm checking this in to sync up with everyone.  But I'm going to split
the add a separate winbindd_allocate_rid() function for systems
that have an 'add user script' but need idmap to give them a RID.
Life would be so much simplier without 'enable rid algorithm'.
The current RID allocation is horrible due to this one fact.
Tested idmap_tdb but not idmap_ldap yet.  Will do that tomorrow.

Nothing has changed in the way a samba domain is represented, stored,
or search in the directory so things should be ok with previous installations.

Add support for the `-fdebug-prefix-map=` option as in GCC.  The syntax is
`-fdebug-prefix-map=OLD=NEW`.  When compiling files from a path beginning with
OLD, change the debug info to indicate the path as start with NEW.  This is
particularly helpful if you are preprocessing in one path and compiling in
another (e.g. for a build cluster with distcc).

Note that the linearity of the implementation is not as terrible as it may seem.
This is normally done once per file with an expectation that the map will be
small (1-2) entries, making this roughly linear in the number of input paths.

This fixes a seemingly minor issue (GH-255) around plans showing changes
when in fact there are none. But in reality this turned out to uncover a
really terrible bug.

The effect of what was happening was that multiple items in a set were
being merged. Now, they were being merged in the right order, so if you
didn't have rich types (lists in a set) then you never saw the effect
since the later value would overwrite the earlier. But with lists (such
as in security groups), you would end up with the lists merging. So, if
you had one ingress rule with CIDR blocks and one with SGs, then after
the merge both ingress rules would have BOTH CIDR and SGs, resulting in
an incorrect plan (GH-255).

This fixes the issue by introducing a `getSourceExact` bitflag to the
ResourceData source. When this is set, ALL data must come from this
level, instead of merging lower levels. In the case of sets and diffs,
this is exactly what you want: ""Get me the set 'foo' from the config and
the config ONLY (not the state or diff or w/e)"".

Andddddd its fixed.

There does seem to be a race condition, but it seems to be related to

xml.[blah].parse() is called, ""dump.xml"" is often absent!

If shutil.rmtree() is failing due to some funky race condition that results
in files the walk doesn't know about being left, then don't worry about it
and continue.

This may leave uniquely named junk lying around in the build tree, but that
is by design not a problem with g-i-scanner. Just don't install the

Re added the old power armor typepaths as there seem to be a few of them in the .dmm and the thing's autocorrect/remove items seems to just fuck up the rest of the map when used.  I have no idea where they are located and don't like leaving errors in the code, so if someone could remove them and the old typepaths it would be great.

Summary: I thought that this will be fun but the elasticsearch API is horrible and the documentation is poor.

Test Plan:
Search for:

- string
- author
- author, owner
- string, author
- open
- string, open, author
- string, exclude
- several authors, several owners
- nothing
- probably all other combinations

Normally, such an exhaustive test plan wouldn't be required but each combination requires a completely different query.

This creates a small internal pass which runs the InstCombiner over
a function. This is the hard part of porting InstCombine to the new pass
manager, as at this point none of the code in InstCombine has access to
a Pass object any longer.

The resulting interface for the InstCombiner is pretty terrible. I'm not
planning on leaving it that way. The key thing missing is that we need
to separate the worklist from the combiner a touch more. Once that's
done, it should be possible for *any* part of LLVM to just create
a worklist with instructions, populate it, and then combine it until
empty. The pass will just be the (obvious and important) special case of
doing that for an entire function body.

For now, this is the first increment of factoring to make all of this
work.

This commit removes the scenario test wrapper around
test_server_basic_ops. This has always caused problems in tempest as
it actually tries to do real operations during discovery which is a
terrible idea. This weighed against a very limited benefit and limited
use by most people it's time to just call the experiment and remove
it. This is not saying there is no usefulness in testing a full matrix
of images and flavors on a real deployment, but instead that the place
for this kind of testing is not in tempest discovery. If people who
found this valuable in the past want to retain the functionality should
help work on an alternative method of doing it that isn't so invasive.

Recently we added a CPU feature for Power9 DD2.0, to capture the fact
that some workarounds are required only on Power9 DD1 and DD2.0 but
not DD2.1 or later.

Then in commit 9d2f510a66ec (""powerpc/64s/idle: avoid POWER9 DD1 and
DD2.0 ERAT workaround on DD2.1"") and commit e3646330cf66
""powerpc/64s/idle: avoid POWER9 DD1 and DD2.0 PMU workaround on
DD2.1"") we changed CPU_FTR_SECTIONs to check for DD1 or DD20, eg:

  BEGIN_FTR_SECTION
          PPC_INVALIDATE_ERAT
  END_FTR_SECTION_IFSET(CPU_FTR_POWER9_DD1 | CPU_FTR_POWER9_DD20)

Unfortunately although this reads as ""if set DD1 or DD2.0"", the or is
a bitwise or and actually generates a mask of both bits. The code that
does the feature patching then checks that the value of the CPU
features masked with that mask are equal to the mask.

So the end result is we're checking for DD1 and DD20 being set, which
never happens. Yes the API is terrible.

Removing the ERAT workaround on DD2.0 results in random SEGVs, the
system tends to boot, but things randomly die including sometimes
dhclient, udev etc.

To fix the problem and hopefully avoid it in future, we remove the
DD2.0 CPU feature and instead add a DD2.1 (or later) feature. This
allows us to easily express that the workarounds are required if DD2.1
is not set.

At some point we will drop the DD1 workarounds entirely and some of
this can be cleaned up.

	check that later.

	Also fix bugs 4128, 4311, and 4344, which are all about a hash
	table NULL critical assertion.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-async.c:
	(dequeue_pending_idle_callback): Handle info in the order it gets
	queued. That requires a call to g_list_reverse since we add things
	with g_list_prepend. Check for NULL to handle case where the info
	is not part of a directory load. Use the new
	nautilus_directory_find_file_by_name to keep it clearly separate
	from code that would find files given relative URIs.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory-private.h: RIP
	nautilus_compare_file_with_name. We haven't used it since we've
	been using a hash table.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-directory.c:
	(add_to_hash_table): Put the relative URI in the hash table, not
	the name.
	(extract_from_hash_table): Look up in the hash table by relative
	URI, not name.
	(nautilus_directory_add_file), (nautilus_directory_remove_file):
	Assertions are based on the relative URI, not the name.
	(nautilus_directory_find_file_by_name): Turn the name into a
	relative URI and search for that.
	(nautilus_directory_find_file_by_relative_uri): Look up in the
	hash table by relative URI, not name.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file-private.h: Replace the name
	field with a relative_uri field. There aren't always names for
	files.

	* libnautilus-extensions/nautilus-file.c:
	(nautilus_file_new_from_relative_uri): Mechanical changes to make
	it create a file given a directory and relative_uri. Uses the new
	update_info_and_name instead of the old nautilus_update_file_info
	(which no longer updates names).
	(nautilus_file_new_from_info). Use the new update_info_and_name
	instead of the old nautilus_update_file_info (which no longer
	updates names).
	(nautilus_file_get_internal): Call nautilus_uri_make_canonical on
	the URI before using it. This is needed now to make the escaping
	of characters in the relative URI uniform. Also made mechanical
	changes to deal with relative URIs instead of file names.
	(destroy): Always free the relative URI. We no longer share the
	name inside the file info, so the logic is now simpler.
	(nautilus_file_get_gnome_vfs_uri): Append the relative URI instead
	of appending a file name to make the full URI.
	(rename_callback): Use the new update_info_and_name instead of the
	old nautilus_update_file_info (which no longer updates
	names). Also call nautilus_find_file_by_name under its new name.
	(name_is): New helper function for checking the file name quickly
	without requiring a local variable.
	(nautilus_file_rename): Use name_is instead of strcmp since the
	name is no longer so readily available.
	(update_info_internal): Moved the guts of nautilus_file_update_info
	in here and made the name-updating part optional. Logic is a bit
	simpler since we don't share the name in the file info any more.
	(update_info_and_name), (nautilus_file_update_info): Covers that
	call the internal call with the ""update_name"" flag set.
	(nautilus_file_update_name): Use name_is and update_info_and_name.
	Also fix the info == NULL case to handle relative URIs, not names.
	(nautilus_file_compare_for_sort): Add a FIXME about using the name
	in the info when sorting. Also change the info == NULL case to get
	the names with nautilus_file_get_name.
	(nautilus_file_compare_name): Use nautilus_file_get_name to get
	the names to compare.

	(nautilus_file_get_integer_metadata),
	(nautilus_file_set_boolean_metadata),
	(nautilus_file_set_integer_metadata): Store metadata using the
	relative URI as the key instead of the name. This amounts to a
	minor metadata file format change.
	(nautilus_file_get_name): Create the name by unescaping the
	relative URI. If this fails, just return the relative URI
	itself. In some cases the URI instead of the name would represent
	a terrible error (but the unescaping will not fail in those
	cases), but in other cases we just need some kind of name.
	(nautilus_file_get_uri): Some broken code in here was just
	appending the name to the parent URI. Now it appends the relative
	URI so it's no longer broken.
	(get_description): Use the relative URI instead of the name in the
	warning message.
	(nautilus_file_mark_gone): Since we always keep the relative URI
	around now, can get rid of the logic that copies the name out of
	the file info for this case.
	(nautilus_file_dump): Since we already dump the URI, don't bother
	dumping the name any more.

We create two constants, write them out to the stack, read them straight back
in and sign extend them. What a mess.

It turns out this bad code is a result of us defining atomic_t as a
volatile int.

We removed the volatile attribute from the powerpc atomic_t definition years
ago, but commit ea435467500612636f8f4fb639ff6e76b2496e4b (atomic_t: unify all
arch definitions) added it back in.

To dig up an old quote from Linus:

And screw up it does :)

With the volatile removed, we see much more reasonable code generation:

Merge the modules of the same name in the module hierarchy of a
product into one. This way we get correct dependency resolution
between properties.
Remove the awful hacks that we have introduced to solve QBS-736 and
QBS-706.
Instead of a hierarchy of QVariantMaps representing all module
values we store a flat map that contains the final (potentially
merged) module values. This leads to a significant speed up in
project loading and rule execution.

According to the SDIO standard interrupts are normally signalled in a
very complicated way.  They require the card clock to be running and
require the controller to be paying close attention to the signals
coming from the card.  This simply can't happen with the clock stopped
or with the controller in a low power mode.

To that end, we'll disable runtime_pm when we detect that an SDIO card
was inserted.  This is much like with what we do with the special
""SDMMC_CLKEN_LOW_PWR"" bit that dw_mmc supports.

NOTE: we specifically do this Runtime PM disabling at card init time
rather than in the enable_sdio_irq() callback.  This is _different_
than how SDHCI does it.  Why do we do it differently?

- Unlike SDHCI, dw_mmc uses the standard sdio_irq code in Linux (AKA
  dw_mmc doesn't set MMC_CAP2_SDIO_IRQ_NOTHREAD).
- Because we use the standard sdio_irq code:
  - We see a constant stream of enable_sdio_irq(0) and
    enable_sdio_irq(1) calls.  This is because the standard code
    disables interrupts while processing and re-enables them after.
  - While interrupts are disabled, there's technically a period where
    we could get runtime disabled while processing interrupts.
  - If we are runtime disabled while processing interrupts, we'll
    reset the controller at resume time (see dw_mci_runtime_resume),
    which seems like a terrible idea because we could possibly have
    another interrupt pending.

To fix the above isues we'd want to put something in the standard
sdio_irq code that makes sure to call pm_runtime get/put when
interrupts are being actively being processed.  That's possible to do,
but it seems like a more complicated mechanism when we really just
want the runtime pm disabled always for SDIO cards given that all the
other bits needed to get Runtime PM vs. SDIO just aren't there.

NOTE: at some point in time someone might come up with a fancy way to
do SDIO interrupts and still allow (some) amount of runtime PM.
Technically we could turn off the card clock if we used an alternate
way of signaling SDIO interrupts (and out of band interrupt is one way
to do this).  We probably wouldn't actually want to fully runtime
suspend in this case though--at least not with the current
dw_mci_runtime_resume() which basically fully resets the controller at
resume time.

Sit tight. This shakes up the world as you know
it. Let go of your spaghetti tongs, they will no
longer be required, the horrible statemachine in
net/mac80211/mlme.c is no more...

With the cfg80211 SME mac80211 now has much less
to keep track of, but, on the other hand, for FT
it needs to be able to keep track of at least one
authentication being in progress while associated.
So convert from a single state machine to having
small ones for all the different things we need to
do. For real FT it will still need work wrt. PS,
but this should be a good step.

REVISIT and get rid of it entirely. :)

This patch refactors ML2 and the db_base_plugin_v2 delete_subnet
method so ML2 can perform its ML2-specific tasks with callbacks
and db_base_plugin_v2 can handle the rest.

The feature is experimental so it's disabled by default and probably has lots
of bugs. To enable it right click on a file/folder in the Files tab of the
Management pane and Select Settings -> [VCS] Integration. Then for folders that
are under that VCS's management, you should see a VCS choice box. Note that
when you select a particular commit using the choice box you are NOT checking 
out that commit so the content of the folder won't be changed. You can 
easily flip back to viewing the folder content itself by selecting ""working copy"". 
While browsing a commit or the working copy in the file manager, you should 
be able to view files and see diffs using the right click menu. Also note that 
performance usually stinks for SVN because of network performance.

This adds codegen to generate stubs for `special._ufuncs` that type
everything as `Any`. Obviously that is terrible typing, but:

- There is still some value-mypy will now tell you if you try to
  access a function in special that doesn't exist
- We need to add `np.ufunc` to the NumPy stubs before we can do it
  right
- It lets us remove a bunch of things from the ratchet.

I think the final point is important-if we remove the ratchet then the
door is opened to actually distributing our types per PEP 561, so it
might be reasonable to get terrible types in place and then gradually
improve them.

The War on Stun Based Combat Phase II
About The Pull Request

A massive change in gameplay that affects more than just disarm. Hopefully in an interesting way.
There's two parts to this, part 1 is that disarm's functionality has been entirely stripped out and replaced with essentially a new purpose: Shoving.
Shoving is the new action that occurs when clicking on people while in the disarm intent.
Shoving someone pushes them one tile away from you. If there is otherwise nothing blocking them, they are slowed down very slightly for 3 seconds. If you shove someone again while they are slowed, it knocks ranged weapons out of their active hand. I'm not sure about this part and may buff or remove it depending on how it works in practice.
If the blocking tile has a table on it, they're pushed onto it knocking them over for 3 seconds. If it has another human on it, it knocks them both over, the collateral victim for 1 second instead of 3. If the tile is otherwise blocked besides them, it knocks them down for 3 seconds. All knockdowns cause you to drop items, and do not stun at all and can be immediately crawled away from.
However, once knocked down, if you are shoved again it paralyzes for 4 seconds. This is the same length as the old disarm push. It cannot be chained or extended, shoving them again while they're paralyzed does not extend the length of the paralyze. Once it ends, the person will be up and moving.
Now you might be thinking, why would I want to shove someone unless they're against a wall?
Here's part 2:
Moving into someone in a hostile intent no longer pushes them. They'll stay where they are and your movement is blocked. If you want to get someone out of the way, you need to shove them.
Why It's Good For The Game

Changes a previously RNG based mechanic that was basically just spammed until you got that lucky ""I win"" roll into a positioning based utility that has a point to use in many situations. Livens up simple melee combat and makes fighting in confined areas more lively and unpredictable. Introduces some new epic gamer strats, I've been playing around and it's pretty fun.
Also why not try something really crazy and see what happens? If it's shit it can be reverted :^)
Changelog

Special thanks to whoneedsspace, the inventor of the singlecap, for deshitcodifying this hard.

cl
add: Disarm has been reworked, instead of an rng based system instead it pushes people away from you. If their movement is blocked it knocks them over. Shoving someone twice quickly will knock ranged weapons out of their hands.
del: Moving into humans while in a hostile intent no longer pushes them.
tweak: Passive grabs need to be resisted out of while on the ground, and can't be directly crawled out of

a specific analysis result.

This is quite handy to test things, and will also likely be very useful
for debugging issues. You could narrow down pass validation failures by
walking these invalidate pass runs up and down the pass pipeline, etc.
I've added support to the pass pipeline parsing to be able to create one
of these for any analysis pass desired.

Just adding this class uncovered one latent bug where the
AnalysisManager CRTP base class had a hard-coded Module type rather than
using IRUnitT.

I've also added tests for invalidation and caching of analyses in
a basic way across all the pass managers. These in turn uncovered two
more bugs where we failed to correctly invalidate an analysis -- its
results were invalidated but the key for re-running the pass was never
cleared and so it was never re-run. Quite nasty. I'm very glad to debug
this here rather than with a full system.

Also, yes, the naming here is horrid. I'm going to update some of the
names to be slightly less awful shortly. But really, I've no ""good""
ideas for naming. I'll be satisfied if I can get it to ""not bad"".

The current gemm threading code can make very unfortunate choices, for
example on my 10 core system a 1024x1024x1024 matrix multiply ends up
chunking into blocks of 102... which is not a vector friendly size
and performance ends up horrible.

this patch adds a helper define where an architecture can specify
a preference for size multiples.
This is different from existing defines that are minimum sizes and such.

widespread glibc bugs.

The glibc implementation of exp10 has a very serious precision bug in
version 2.15 (and older versions). This is still very widely used (the
current Ubuntu LTS for example uses it) and so it isn't reasonable to
make transforms that produce these functions. This fixes many
miscompiles introduced when we started transforming pow(10.0, ...) into
exp10, and it may have fixed other latent miscompiles where exp10
provided sufficient precision but exp10f did not.

This is all really horrible. The primary bug has been fixed for over
a year and glibc 2.18 works correctly for the test cases I have, but it
will be 2017 before the LTS using 2.15 is no longer supported by Ubuntu
(and thus reasonable for folks to be relying on). =[ We're either going
to need to live without these optimizations, or find a way to switch
behavior more dynamically than using simply the fact that the OS is
""Linux"".

To make matters worse, there appears to be significant testing and
fixing of numerous other bugs in the exp10 family of functions right now
in glibc. While those haven't been causing problems I've seen in the
wild, it gives me concerns that we may need to wait until an even later
release of glibc before we can reliably transform code into exp10.

There's no reason for MIPS to select EMBEDDED.  In fact, EMBEDDED makes
MIPS more awkward to deal with because it makes it different to the
majority of architectures for no good reason.

[Ralf: Historically disabling EMBEDDED had hid essential options for many
 MIPS platforms such as serial console and forced crap like VGA support
 or power managment enabled for platforms where those don't make any sense.

 The name of the option is also _very_ missleading so many users don't
 select it even where is was required for a functioning kernel.]

by eliminating the type ID from constructor, destructor, and
conversion function names. There are several reasons for this change:
  - A given type (say, int*) isn't guaranteed to have a single, unique
  type ID within a chain of PCH files. Hence, we could end up hashing
  based on the wrong type ID, causing name lookup to fail.

  - The mapping from types back to type IDs required one DenseMap
  entry for every type that was ever deserialized, which was an
  unacceptable cost to support just the name lookup of constructors,
  destructors, and conversion functions. Plus, this mapping could
  never actually work with chained or multiple PCH, based on the first
  bullet.

Once we have eliminated the type from the hash function, these
problems go away, as does my horrible ""reverse type remap"" hack, which
was doomed from the start (see bullet #1 above) and far too
complicated. 

However, note that removing the type from the hash function means that
all constructors, destructors, and conversion functions have the same
hash key, so I've updated the caller to double-check that the
declarations found have the appropriate name.

a run-time sized bitmap.  Moreover, gcc also emits a function call for a
compile-time-constant-but-huge nbits, so the comment isn't even accurate.

Changing the width or height of a (right or bottom positioned)wibox,
after it was initialized, to a value different than used when it was
created would leave the wibox in a wrong position. Position was off by
as many pixels as the difference between the old and the new
value. Now every wibox is repositioned to reflect this new setup.

Reverts some of the special styles that `purchase-detail` received in `purchase-feature-list` to use default paddings. Also displays buttons appropriately now on small screens.

No applies to both button and anchor elements. Buttons have their text
center aligned anyway, so there is no need to single out anchors.

This all started to support

```yaml
version: latest
```

In `tests.yaml` to automatically download and run the latest
elasticsearch snapshot. Plugins do not quite install nicely on
elasticsearch snapshots so I needed to disable it if we are running
against a snapshot which led to a shit ton of refactoring down a very
slippery slope.

- Internalize semanticversioning so we do not have to special case
  CoreFX
- ElasticsearchVersion extends SemanticVersion (renamed SemVer.Version)
- rename `do_not_spawn` to `test_against_already_running_elasticsearch`
- Send ContentType as well as Accept (needed for alpha2) @forloop should
  we just use one config setting to send both headers?
- `[Collection(IntegrationContext.ReadOnly)]` is now
  `[Collection(TypeOfCluster.ReadOnly)]` which i think is more
   descriptive
- Split all the filesystem manipulation from `ElasticsearchNode` into
  `INodeFileSystem` of which we now have one implementation
  `TestRunnerFileSystem` but could be used for e.g
  `ProductionFileSystem` if we are intend on shipping this as part of the
  installer.
- Regrouped everything under `Framework` folder into a (hopefully) more
  logical structure
- Tried to minimize the various different ways clients are created.
- UrlTester and ApiTestBase now validate expected urls the same way
- We now deal with exceptions happening before starting (e.g using bad
  settings) way better and faster, they will surfice as their own
  exception rather then a WaitHandle exception.
- ObservableProcess now spits out `ConsoleOut` instead of `string` and
  `ElasticsearchMessage` extends `ConsoleOut` and is renamed to
  `ElasticsearchConsoleOut`
- Plugins we support are now registered in the static
  `ElasticsearchPlugins`.
- `ClusterBase` definitions or can now be marked with
  `RequiresPluginAttribute` which dictate which plugins MUST be
   available.
- Plugin validation is disabled against SNAPSHOT versions and any
  test part of Cluster Collection with a `RequiresPluginAttribute` are
  automatically skipped.
- Tests now start and run OK when running against alpha2
- Tons of tiny fixes

Tested:

> build
> build integrate 5.0.0-alpha1
> build integrate 5.0.0-alpha2-SNAPSHOT
> build integrate latest

The latter still has 27 failures but atleast the clusters start properly
and plugin tests are ignored!

Summary:
Fixes T9808.

An instance imported a very large repository, generating approximately 4 million tasks over the course of a few days. A week later, these tasks started expiring and became candidates for garbage collection.

The GC works by deleting 100 rows at at time over and over again. It finds the rows it's going to delete by querying for old rows.

Currently, this query generates a `WHERE dateCreated < X ORDER BY id DESC` query. This query can not efficiently execute using a single key, because it relies on `dateCreated` order to find the rows, then on `id` order to sort them. With a table with 4M rows, this is slow.

This would still be OK, except that the query has to execute a lot of times since it only deletes 100 rows each time. Particularly, it needs to execute a total of ~40K times.

Instead, generate `WHERE dateCreated < X ORDER BY dateCreated DESC, id DESC`. This should have the same effect in general and the GC definitely doesn't care about the difference, but it should be more efficient at large scales.

Test Plan:
I had to `TRUNCATE` the problem table so I don't have a perfect repro to completely convincingly test this anymore. Both queries behave fine at small scales, which is why we haven't seen this before.

I was able to run the newer query in production before I nuked the table and have it complete in a reasonable amount of time, while the old query hung longer than I wanted to wait (several minutes?). The query plan for the new query was also a good one, while the query plan for the old query was terrible.

I loaded the daemon console and ran `bin/garbage collect --collector worker.tasks --trace`. I verified the queries looked reasonable and produced reasonable results in production.

","Removed the alertness level thing for carp/hostile mobs in general. Neat idea in theory, but in practice it just meant people could run up and beat carp to death before they'd even enter their hostile state. Bears still have it though. 

Carp are slightly faster (in testing, I walked away from one as a borg, this seems a bit silly). This might not work well in practice though what with lag on a live server, so I'm guessing I might have to change this back.

Carp/syndicate also keep chasing their target as long as they're within 10 tiles, to compensate for them being slower than humans.

Removed the restriction on debraining changelings, this was a terrible ""fix"" to half-changelings and just lets you metagame.

Added a mineral var (metal) to floors to stop runtimes when you hit them with mining tools.

The name of this method has plagued me for years, so I figured I would
finally propose a fix. The reason v3_authenticate_token() is a terrible
name is that it implies that a token is being authenticated (in other
words: validated). As it turns out, we have another operation that
validates tokens, and this isn't it.

By renaming the method to v3_create_token() there is absolutely no
confusion about the intended outcome. This also more closely reflects
how we colloquially refer to operation.

v3_authenticate() might have also have been an improvement, but could
lead to the same confusion we have today (whether or not the user is
authenticating with keystone or whether a service is authenticating a
token).

Accordingly, we get to remove Carlos's horrible hack adding markup to
the completion model (which in MVC should only model, not contain
style), and Claudio's horrible hack adding a bool property to make the
markup optional (to avoid breaking the search provider, which also uses
the completion model).

The markup was originally moved to the completion model in order to
remove the cell data function, which was being run continuously due to
some bug. Because GdTwoLinesRenderer uses real cell attributes to
display the title and url separately, we no longer need to worry at all
about the task it used to perform -- merging the title and url into one
string, with a newline and formatting markup to control size and color
of the second line. GdTwoLinesRenderer takes care of this much more
cleanly.

The only user-visible change is that it is now possible to read URLs in
the completion when the row is selected, as the gray is darker.
Apparently some people can read it fine, but the color was too similar to
the selection blue on the three monitors I tested.

The current security driver usage requires horrible code like

    if (driver->securityDriver &&
        driver->securityDriver->domainSetSecurityHostdevLabel &&
        driver->securityDriver->domainSetSecurityHostdevLabel(driver->securityDriver,
                                                              vm, hostdev) < 0)

This pair of checks for NULL clutters up the code, making the driver
calls 2 lines longer than they really need to be. The goal of the
patchset is to change the calling convention to simply

  if (virSecurityManagerSetHostdevLabel(driver->securityDriver,
                                        vm, hostdev) < 0)

The first check for 'driver->securityDriver' being NULL is removed
by introducing a 'no op' security driver that will always be present
if no real driver is enabled. This guarentees driver->securityDriver
!= NULL.

The second check for 'driver->securityDriver->domainSetSecurityHostdevLabel'
being non-NULL is hidden in a new abstraction called virSecurityManager.
This separates the driver callbacks, from main internal API. The addition
of a virSecurityManager object, that is separate from the virSecurityDriver
struct also allows for security drivers to carry state / configuration
information directly. Thus the DAC/Stack drivers from src/qemu which
used to pull config from 'struct qemud_driver' can now be moved into
the 'src/security' directory and store their config directly.

  First stab at generating Cristin-XML out of Cerebrum without hacks.
  
  The process is two-fold:
  
    + A table, person_employment, must be populated from a suitable source. 
      For UiA, HiØ and the like this will be SSØ-SAP and 
      process_SAP_affiliations.py. For UiO the code hasn't been written yet, 
      but it'd be something similar.
    + generate-cristin-export.py must be run to produce the XML file itself.
  
  This requires mod_employment.sql and its extension to Person (PersonEmployment).

I have mainly created the rugments fork for the purpose of improving
gitlab's highlighting. Nowadays IMO it works way better than the old
highlight.js solution. But the development is stuck on my side because
of a couple of personal reasons:

  * I have finished my studies; last months I was writing my master
    thesis. So there was a huge time problem. I am sorry for that.

  * I had to move to Munich due to getting a (paid) job. Searching a
    flat here is horrible... :)

  * Last but not least, maintaining the same code base in two seperate
    projects is a mess.

I have decided to switch back to rouge due to several reasons:

  * In the beginning I was quite motivated, but since I start
    working on my new job next week, the best solution IMO is
    switching back to upstream rouge.

  * Rouge is continously improving:
    https://github.com/jneen/rouge/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md
    http://rouge.jneen.net/

  * There should be absolutely no regressions with this change. Most
    likely this pull request will almost fix some minor bugs.

  * One less gem in gitlab is a good thing. since Gitlab is quite a
    huge bundle of gems. Reducing complexity should be a major
    milestone.

Thanks a lot to @stanhu and @jneen for the review!

When a CPU is offlined nothing checks whether it is the target CPU for the
package temperature sysfs interface.

As a consequence all future readouts of the package temperature return
crap:

90000

which is Tjmax of that package.

Check whether the outgoing CPU is the target for the package and assign it
to some other still online CPU in the package. Protect the change against

Sometimes we seem to get utter garbage from DPCD reads. The resulting
buffer is filled with the same byte, and the operation completed without
errors. My HP ZR24w monitor seems particularly susceptible to this
problem once it's gone into a sleep mode.

The issue seems to happen only for the first AUX message that wakes the
sink up. But as the first AUX read we often do is the DPCD receiver
cap it does wreak a bit of havoc with subsequent link training etc. when
the receiver cap bw/lane/etc. information is garbage.

A sufficient workaround seems to be to perform a single byte dummy read
before reading the actual data. I suppose that just wakes up the sink
sufficiently and we can just throw away the returned data in case it's
crap. DP_DPCD_REV seems like a sufficiently safe location to read here.

Remove the compile time warning when CONFIG_RETPOLINE=y and the compiler
does not have retpoline support. Linus rationale for this is:

  It's wrong because it will just make people turn off RETPOLINE, and the
  asm updates - and return stack clearing - that are independent of the
  compiler are likely the most important parts because they are likely the
  ones easiest to target.

  And it's annoying because most people won't be able to do anything about
  it. The number of people building their own compiler? Very small. So if
  their distro hasn't got a compiler yet (and pretty much nobody does), the
  warning is just annoying crap.

  It is already properly reported as part of the sysfs interface. The
  compile-time warning only encourages bad things.

Summary:
Clang performs various recursive operations (such as template instantiation),
and may use non-trivial amounts of stack space in each recursive step (for
instance, due to recursive AST walks). While we try to keep the stack space
used by such steps to a minimum and we have explicit limits on the number of
such steps we perform, it's impractical to guarantee that we won't blow out the
stack on deeply recursive template instantiations on complex ASTs, even with
only a moderately high instantiation depth limit.

The user experience in these cases is generally terrible: we crash with
no hint of what went wrong. Under this patch, we attempt to do better:

 * Detect when the stack is nearly exhausted, and produce a warning with a
   nice template instantiation backtrace, telling the user that we might
   run slowly or crash.

 * For cases where we're forced to trigger recursive template
   instantiation in arbitrarily-deeply-nested contexts, check whether
   we're nearly out of stack space and allocate a new stack (by spawning
   a new thread) after producing the warning.

binfmt_misc has a mount point in the middle of the sysctl and that mount point
is created as a proc_generic directory.

Doing it that way gets in the way of cleaning up the sysctl proc support as it
continues the existence of a horrible hack.  So instead simply create the
directory as an ordinary sysctl directory.  At least that removes the magic
special case.

Summary: PHP 5.4 raises an E_STRICT warning about ""/e"", and it's a generally awful idea, even though this case doesn't look exploitable. Silence the warning by using preg_replace_callback() instead of ""/e"".

Test Plan: Sent myself a message with a bunch of multibyte UTF8 characters in it, it came through cleanly.

When I wrote sch_fq.c, hash_ptr() on 64bit arches was awful,
and I chose hash_32().

Linus Torvalds and George Spelvin fixed this issue, so we can
use hash_ptr() to get more entropy on 64bit arches with Terabytes
of memory, and avoid the cast games.

will be adding base register re-use and implementing a reasonable ARM
heuristic for when a virtual base register should be generated at all.

This limits the amount of damage a pathological program can cause in
thrashing the LRU cache.

I ran the script described here:
https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/pull/1327#issuecomment-374003960

Without this patch, the entire output would get drawn in one frame that
took about 140 ms to draw. With this patch, it takes about 60 ms. It's
still nowhere as good as the static or none atlas implementations, but
it's not terrible, like it was.

This should have minimal impact on real-world applications: it'll just
take a little longer for the atlas to warm up.

The implementation is a little hacky, since it involves throwing some
code into TextRenderLayer that violates the separation of concerns, but
we can clean this up later.

UBI was mistakingly using 'kfree()' instead of 'kmem_cache_free()' when
freeing ""attach eraseblock"" structures in vtbl.c. Thankfully, this happened
only when we were doing auto-format, so many systems were unaffected. However,
there are still many users affected.

It is strange, but the system did not crash and nothing bad happened when
the SLUB memory allocator was used. However, in case of SLOB we observed an
crash right away.

This problem was introduced in 2.6.39 by commit
""6c1e875 UBI: add slab cache for ubi_scan_leb objects""

A note for stable trees:
  Because variable were renamed, this won't cleanly apply to older kernels.
  Changing names like this should help:
	1. ai -> si
	2. aeb_slab_cache -> seb_slab_cache
	3. new_aeb -> new_seb

Some targets need 4K sectors for small flash chips (e.g. some
routerboards, where the entire chip is just one ""erase block""), whereas
on other devices 4K sectors lead to horrible flash erase/write
performance.

Set the default limit in the generic kernel configuration to 4 MiB to
ensure that all new platforms don't use 4K sectors for bigger flash
chips. On all existing targets use 16 MiB for now to avoid regressions.
They will be changed individually in follow-up commits.

Summary:
Ref T10939. This lets you add packages as reviewers manually.

""Project Reviewers"" now lists both projects and packages. I have renamed this to ""Coalition Reviewers"" but that's probably horrible and confusing. I'm not sure ""Group Reviewers"" is much better.

Test Plan:
  - Added a package as a reviewer manually.
  - Joined it, got authority over it.
  - Saw the review on my dashboard.
  - Accepted the revision, got authority extended to the package review.

About The Pull Request

Dragging prone mobs (resting, knocked down, stunned, dead, in crit, etc) that aren't buckled to anything slows you down.

You can fireman carry by aggressive grabbing then click dragging onto yourself. This causes a slight speed penalty that is lower than dragging.
Why It's Good For The Game

Prevents the classic ""stun and beat the shit out of while zipping off"" which is obnoxious and I don't think anybody likes besides the people who do it.
Makes it so if you feel like being a cunt you can rest while being arrested to make you a pain to take back.
Makes it harder to steal bodies and move away before anybody can properly react, but makes dragging bodies riskier at the same time
Fireman carrying adds an element of risk reward, it takes a little while of standing still to pick them up and also slows you down slightly. More useful to move someone a long distance out of a relatively safe area than a quick pull away.

Summary:
For Admission Control, we added two columns to the acl table.
The code to read this in mysql 5.1 and 5.6 is completely terrible.
So, acl table data created by our 5.1 causes 5.6 to explode.

Skip reading the last two acl columns, if there aren't at least 3 there.
This allows us to dodge those we used for admission control in 5.1, since,
if the extra columns from 5.6 are present, there will be at least 3 more.

This works around reading these tables, long enough to run mysql_upgrade.

Also mysql_upgrade now drops these two obsolete Admission Control columns,
if present, before addding the three new 5.6 acl columns.

For this to work, mysql_upgrade also had to ignore:
	ERROR 1091: Can't DROP '<column_name>'; ...
So, this was also added to its expected errors list.

This, in turn, required updating of some perfschema test results,
since they include line numbers of errors.

Note that if mysql_upgrade is not run, things (like new GRANTS) will cause
bad failures in 5.6 if our old 5.1 format tables are used.

Test Plan:
Deployed 5.1 and 5.6 RPMs on a spare, and upgraded cleanly!
Jenkins 'arc unit' likes this too.

patterns.

This is causing Clang to miscompile itself for 32-bit x86 somehow, and likely
also on ARM and PPC. I really don't know how, but reverting now that I've
confirmed this is actually the culprit. I have a reproduction as well and so
should be able to restore this shortly.

This reverts commit r223764.

Original commit log follows:
Teach instcombine to canonicalize ""element extraction"" from a load of an
integer and ""element insertion"" into a store of an integer into actual
element extraction, element insertion, and vector loads and stores.

Previously various parts of LLVM (including instcombine itself) would
introduce integer loads and stores into the code as a way of opaquely
loading and storing ""bits"". In some cases (such as a memcpy of
std::complex<float> object) we will eventually end up using those bits
in non-integer types. In order for SROA to effectively promote the
allocas involved, it splits these ""store a bag of bits"" integer loads
and stores up into the constituent parts. However, for non-alloca loads
and tsores which remain, it uses integer math to recombine the values
into a large integer to load or store.

All of this would be ""fine"", except that it forces LLVM to go through
integer math to combine and split up values. While this makes perfect
sense for integers (and in fact is critical for bitfields to end up
lowering efficiently) it is *terrible* for non-integer types, especially
floating point types. We have a much more canonical way of representing
the act of concatenating the bits of two SSA values in LLVM: a vector
and insertelement. This patch teaching InstCombine to use this
representation.

With this patch applied, LLVM will no longer introduce integer math into
the critical path of every loop over std::complex<float> operations such
as those that make up the hot path of ... oh, most HPC code, Eigen, and
any other heavy linear algebra library.

For the record, I looked *extensively* at fixing this in other parts of
the compiler, but it just doesn't work:
- We really do want to canonicalize memcpy and other bit-motion to
  integer loads and stores. SSA values are tremendously more powerful
  than ""copy"" intrinsics. Not doing this regresses massive amounts of
  LLVM's scalar optimizer.
- We really do need to split up integer loads and stores of this form in
  SROA or every memcpy of a trivially copyable struct will prevent SSA
  formation of the members of that struct. It essentially turns off
  SROA.
- The closest alternative is to actually split the loads and stores when
  partitioning with SROA, but this has all of the downsides historically
  discussed of splitting up loads and stores -- the wide-store
  information is fundamentally lost. We would also see performance
  regressions for bitfield-heavy code and other places where the
  integers aren't really intended to be split without seemingly
  arbitrary logic to treat integers totally differently.
- We *can* effectively fix this in instcombine, so it isn't that hard of

Summary:
The reason libc++ implemented a throwing debug mode handler was for ease of testing. Specifically,
I thought that if a debug violation aborted, we could only test one violation per file. This made
it impossible to test debug mode. Which throwing behavior we could test more!

However, the throwing approach didn't work either, since there are debug violations underneath noexcept
functions. This lead to the introduction of `_NOEXCEPT_DEBUG`, which was only noexcept when debug
mode was off.

Having thought more and having grown wiser, `_NOEXCEPT_DEBUG` was a horrible decision. It was
viral, it didn't cover all the cases it needed to, and it was observable to the user -- at worst
changing the behavior of their program.

  This patch removes the throwing debug handler, and rewrites the debug tests using 'fork-ing' style
  death tests.

This config item has not carried much meaning for a while now and is
almost always enabled by default (especially in distro builds). As agreed
during the Linux kernel summit, it should be removed. As a first step,
remove it from being listed, and default it to on. Once it has been
removed from all subsystem Kconfigs, it will be dropped entirely.

For items that really are experimental, maintainers should use ""default
n"", optionally include ""(EXPERIMENTAL)"" in the title, and add language to
the help text indicating why the item should be considered experimental.

For items that are dangerously experimental, the maintainer is encouraged
to follow the above title recommendation, add stronger language to the
help text, and optionally use (depending on the extent of the danger,
from least to most dangerous): printk(), add_taint(TAINT_WARN),
add_taint(TAINT_CRAP), WARN_ON(1), and CONFIG_BROKEN.

Although the cmd11 interrupt should come within 2ms, that's a very
short time.  Let's increase the timeout to be really sure that we
don't get an accidnetal timeout.  One case in particular this is
useful is if you've got a serial console and printk in just the right
places.  Under that scenario I've seen delays of up to 130ms before
the interrupt fired.

CMD11 is only sent during card insertion, so this extra timeout
shouldn't be terrible.

Summary:
We constantly have to pass around `profiling` because it's immutable.
Every time we would time something, it would return a new record and we'd have
to propagate that. It was kind of a pain.

While mutability is usually pretty terrible, it's really useful to make
profiling and logging less of a burden.

Choosing what and how to mount where was a real pain.
This would all be far simpler if linux had a usable unionfs. overlay
file system doesn't count, it's just not usable for this purpose.

I wrote one in 1996 that implemented plan 9 style unions but could never get them to
use it. It was about 200 lines.

example usage:

cpu to the port redirect we set up in the qemu command, setting server port to 23 and running bash.
The bash will come from the node we are on via the 9p mount.

Amazingly, we just never triggered this without:
1) Moving code around for MetadataTracking so that a certain *different*
   amount of inlining occurs in the per-TU compile step.
2) Then you LTO opt or clang with a bootstrap, and get inlining, loop
   opts, and GVN line up everything *just* right.

I don't really know how we didn't hit this before. We really need to be
fuzz testing stuff, it shouldn't be hard to trigger. I'm working on
crafting a reduced nice test case, and will submit that when I have it,
but I want to get LTO build bots going again.

This patch converts the AIO bootstrap process to use Ansible
instead of bash scripting. The patch also minimises the options
available to focus the role concerned to just handle an AIO
bootstrap, but gives it just enough flexibility to allow the
use of an external MongoDB database for Ceilometer/Aodh and
for a deployer to specify a secondary disk for the AIO to
consume.

A major change is that the AIO bootstrap process no longer
assumes that it can destroy a secondary boot device. It
requires a device name to be provided. This prevents horrible
surprises.

TODO (in subsequent patches):
 - update the developer AIO docs
 - convert run-playbooks.sh into an Ansible playbook

This change should make sure that only those settings actually make it into config.yaml
per plugin that do differ from the default settings. Up until now the full dictionary as received
e.g. from the REST API was saved, regardless whether it contained (only) default values or not.
That led to a lot of ""null"" entries in the config.yaml file, which for one looked horrible and also
led to problems when a plugin actually wanted to change its default values.

With this commit, two things are done. One, upon saving a configuration the default
implementation of the save routine in the settings plugin now first diffs the new data against
the defaults and only saves what is different. Two, upon server startup a cleanup method is
now called on settings plugins whose default implementation fetches the current data stored
in config.yaml, diffs that against the defaults and only writes back the diff result. If that is empty
the entry is completely deleted from config.yaml.

Yuck.

This first change defines clearer prototypes - including ""typedef""'d
function pointer types to use as ""hash"" and ""compare"" callbacks, as well as
the callbacks passed to the lh_doall and lh_doall_arg iteration functions.
Now at least more explicit (and clear) casting is required in all of the
dependant code - and that should be included in this commit.

The next step will be to hunt down and obliterate some of the function
pointer casting being used when it's not necessary - a particularly evil
variant exists in the implementation of lh_doall.

Summary:
In CUDA compilation, we call isInlineDefinitionExternallyVisible (via
getGVALinkageForFunction) on functions while parsing their definitions.

At the point in time when we call getGVALinkageForFunction, we haven't
yet added the body to the function, so we trip this assert.  But as far
as I can tell, this is harmless.

To work around this, we add a new flag to FunctionDecl, ""WillHaveBody"".

There was other code that was working around the existing assert with a
really awful hack -- this change lets us get rid of that hack.

There are certain points in the lifecycle of PuppetDB where it's
critical that we properly log an exception, even if that means we spam
different log targets (logfiles, stdout, stderr, etc) and duplicate
output.

Daemon startup is one of these critical points. An error during
startup should be logged as thoroughly as possible, as there's no
really good way to debug the issue otherwise (as the daemon will
terminate upon error, making it hard to do meaningful
live-debugging). This becomes doubly-important when you consider that
99% of users are launching PuppetDB via an init script of some sort,
and init scripts can do funky things with the stdout and stderr
streams of launched processes. On some platforms, that stuff is
captured for you. On others, it goes to the users interactive
terminal. And still on others, it ends up in the aether never to be
seen again.

The other critical point is when a thread dies due to an unhandled
exception. I'd prefer that never occur but, well, shit happens yo. You
can register a callback with the JVM whenever a unhandled exception
occurs, so we can use the same verbose logging routines we employ
during daemon startup to ensure that unhandled exceptions get some
degree of debuggability.

Better safe than sorry, and I'd prefer to err on the side of logging
too much during these critical sections of code than log too little.

This is a horrible hack needed because the client sends 2 packets on
'right mouse click' aimed at a block.
We shouldn't need to get the second packet if the data is handled but we cannot
know what the client will do, so we might still get it.
If the time between packets is small enough, and the 'signature' similar, we
discard the second one. This sadly has to remain until Mojang makes their
packets saner.

advantage of the existence of a reasonable blend instruction.

The 256-bit vector shuffle lowering has leveraged the general technique
of decomposed shuffles and blends for quite some time, but this never
made it back into the 128-bit code, and there are a large number of
patterns where this is substantially better. For example, this removes
almost all domain crossing in vector shuffles that involve some blend
and some permutation with SSE4.1 and later. See the massive reduction
in 'shufps' for integer test cases in this commit.

This isn't perfect yet for a few reasons:

1) The v8i16 shuffle lowering continues to plague me. We don't always
   form an unpack-based blend when that would be better. But the wins
   pretty drastically outstrip the losses here.
2) The v16i8 shuffle lowering is just a disaster here. I never went and
   implemented blend support here for some terrible reason. I'll do
   that next probably. I've not updated it for now.

More variations on this technique are coming as well -- we don't
shuffle-into-unpack or shuffle-into-palignr, both of which would also be
profitable.

Note that some test cases grow significantly in the number of
instructions, but I expect to actually be faster. We use
pshufd+pshufd+blendw instead of a single shufps, but the pshufd's are
very likely to pipeline well (two ports on most modern intel chips) and
the blend is a *very* fast instruction. The domain switch penalty will
essentially always be more than a blend instruction, which is the only
increase in tree height.

Correctly expand list of nearby people to the entire height of the screen.

NOTE: To be cherry-picked into stable-v0.100

If the device is small, then the ""Conenct and trade apps with people
near you"" header takes up too much space and we end up not being able
to see any nearby people at all, even if they are in the list. As
such, this also removes that header for ""small"" and ""ldpi""
devices. During testing I found that ""small"" was not enough, because a
240x400 screen is considered ""medium"" and there is not enough
space. ldpi seems to be a reasonable metric for ""that header is going
to be taking valuable space and should not be shown then"".

All larger devices retain the header and seem to look nice.

This also pushes the ""Can't find what you're looking for?"" message and
associated buttons right to the bottom of the screen. This is more in
line with the original design.

Fixes #604.
Screenshots
No good

The image below shows a 240x400 device. This falls into the ""medium""
screen size, and so would include the header if I only used
""layout-small"". As such, I also removed the header for
""layout-ldpi"". It doesn't look absolutely terrible, but remember that
this is an emulator without Bluetooth, and as such it is missing a UI
element for enablign Bluetooth which would take up the remaining real
estate:

emu-240x400
Good

Large devices work well now, with all of the empty space below
available for the ""Nearby Devices"":

large_device

Also, small devices should exclude the header and provide just enough
space for the list of pears (as shon by this 240x320 device):

emu-240x320dp

Terrible workaround to make Nginx's retry logic work the same on the cache
boxes regardless of whether they are running Lucid or Precise. This
maintains the behaviour of retrying a connection against Varnish if the
first one fails (per proxy_next_upstream). Will allow us to upgrade the
remainder of these nodes.

Longer term we should review why this differs between the same upstream
version on different Ubuntu versions, what packages we're using, whether we
should upgrade to a newer stable release, and whether it affects other node
classes.

Currently we're flipping the radio in ""MMS"" mode, and connecting through
any proxies specified in the APN.  This always work, or at least doesn't
seem to work on Sprint, since the configured mms proxy rejects proxy
requests.

Instead we try the following in this order:

1) Connect over normal data connection directly to MMSC.
2) Connect over MMS radio connection to MMSC.

Commit aa1792eb4c1d10e9a192142ce7e20d37871d916a added more verbose
logging of the various database and hypervisor states when
_sync_instance_power_state is called (which can be called from
handle_lifecycle_event - triggered by the libvirt driver, or from the
_sync_power_states periodic task).

This change adds logging of when the power_state in the database does
not match the power_state from the hypervisor, and then the power_state
in the database is updated to match what's in the hypervisor.

Also, we save the original database power_state for logging when we have
cases of stopping an active instance due to vm_state / power_state
conflicts, or stopping a ""stopped"" instance but the hypervisor says is
still running.

This is all needed because debugging the various things that can hit
this code at different times and cause problems is, well, terrible.

AssertingVH that delays any reported error until the handle is *used*.

This allows data structures to contain handles which become dangling
provided the data structure is cleaned up afterward rather than used for
anything interesting.

The implementation is moderately horrible in part because it works to
leave AssertingVH in place, undisturbed. If at some point there is
consensus that this is simply how AssertingVH should be used, it can be
substantially simplified.

This remains a boring pointer in a non-asserts build as you would
expect. The only place we pay cost is in asserts builds.

I plan to use this as a basis for replacing the asserting VHs that
currently dangle in the new PM until invalidation occurs in both LVI and
SCEV.

Again a pile of things all over
- Conversion to rst from docbook from Jani. Looks real pretty, and the
  source is now actually readable (compared to horrible, horrible docbook
  xml)! https://01.org/linuxgraphics/gfx-docs/drm/
- device register/unregister rework from Chris, with follow-up work from
  Benjamin. Allows more drivers to demidlayer load/unload and others to
  remove a bit of boilerplate.
- master/auth related cleanup, with docs
- some dma-buf polish, merged by Sumit
- small stuff all over (like build fixes from Arnd)

Group maintainership seems to slowly take off, with both Thierry and Sumit
pushing a few things. No hiccups thus far.

[GCE] Set --kubelet-preferred-address-types on apiserver by default

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
We currently set the default value of `PreferredAddressTypes` in `KubeletConfig` for apiserver as below:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/2f403b7ad18a179514f1de77e29f1a2549ef030a/cmd/kube-apiserver/app/options/options.go#L99-L110

It denotes the ways (order matters) we prefer to use for kubelet connections, in which `NodeHostName` is listed as the most preferred one. However, it is not safe to assume `NodeHostName` will always be resolvable. This PR makes `InternalIP` as the most preferred one instead.

Note that this doesn't affect how the ssh tunnel is setup, which is configured explicitly elsewhere:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/d0d1e1dcc473d75c5dae6d4710ac67f4f8ba44c6/pkg/master/master.go#L442-L445

The participants page will now show (to users that have
moodle/role:assign) the relevant enrolments for each participant.

This is done with a second SELECT using a WHERE id IN() so we are
limited to doing it with small datasets. This is for 2 reasons

 - we cannot retrieve all teh data in the ""main"" SELECT because
   the outer joins will bring dup rows, breaking LIMIT

 - we cannot use the main SELECT as a subselect because we cannot
   retrieve the LIMIT part of the statement with the current dmllib

 - on large courses / sitecourse performance would be horrible

so it is limited to paginated datasets. It is doing 20 recs at a time,
the ""extra"" SELECT takes ~7ms on a some large Pg databases).

This will generate an extra DB query on Oracle (and any other DB that
cannot rewind the recordset) because we walk the main rs twice.

While at it, ensure we mark the unsortable columns thus...

Summary:
Add a new left-side application menu. This menu shows which application you're in and provides a quick way to get to other applications.

On desktops, menus are always shown but the app menu can be collapsed to be very small.

On tablets, navigation buttons allow you to choose between the menus and the content.

On phones, navigation buttons allow you to choose between the app menu, the local menu, and the content.

This needs some code and UI cleanup, but has no effect yet so I think it's okay to land as-is, I'll clean it up a bit as I start integrating it. I want to play around with it a bit and see if it's good/useful or horrible anyway.

Test Plan: Will include screenshots.

that splat i8s into i16s.

Previously, we would try much too hard to arrange a sequence of i8s in
one half of the input such that we could unpack them into i16s and
shuffle those into place. This isn't always going to be a cheaper i8
shuffle than our other strategies. The case where it is always going to
be cheaper is when we can arrange all the necessary inputs into one half
using just i16 shuffles. It happens that viewing the problem this way
also makes it much easier to produce an efficient set of shuffles to
move the inputs into one half and then unpack them.

With this, our splat code gets one step closer to being not terrible
with the new experimental lowering strategy. It also exposes two
combines missing which I will add next.

implement() is setting bytes in LE data stream. In case the data is not
aligned to 64bits, it reads past the allocated buffer. It doesn't really
change any value there (it's properly bitmasked), but in case that this
read past the boundary hits a page boundary, pagefault happens when
accessing 64bits of 'x' in implement(), and kernel oopses.

This happens much more often when numbered reports are in use, as the
initial 8bit skip in the buffer makes the whole process work on values
which are not aligned to 64bits.

This problem dates back to attempts in 2005 and 2006 to make implement()
and extract() as generic as possible, and even back then the problem
was realized by Adam Kroperlin, but falsely assumed to be impossible
to cause any harm:

  http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-usb-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg47690.html

I have made several attempts at fixing it ""on the spot"" directly in
implement(), but the results were horrible; the special casing for processing
last 64bit chunk and switching to different math makes it unreadable mess.

I therefore took a path to allocate a few bytes more which will never make
it into final report, but are there as a cushion for all the 64bit math
operations happening in implement() and extract().

All callers of hid_output_report() are converted at the same time to allocate
the buffer by newly introduced hid_alloc_report_buf() helper.

Bruno noticed that the whole raw_size test can be dropped as well, as
hid_alloc_report_buf() makes sure that the buffer is always of a proper
size.

This is going to be unpopular, and if you're reading this in anger, I'm sorry.
I think it looks good, but it messes up some people's existing setups, which is
a shame. You can change it back to 2 in advanced settings > height of top and
bottom margins in terminal panes, but doing so will disable the Metal renderer.

The reason is this:

On macOS, a Metal view can overlap its window's rounded corners. It looks
terrible, and is made especially obvious because Metal is switched on and off
all the time because MTKView is the leakiest abstraction ever.

There are three possible solutions.

1. Put the root view in a layer. This is a no-go because it almost halves the
frame rate.

2. Make the metal view's CAMetalLayer non-opaque and cut out the corners. This
is a no-go because it also almost halves the frame rate.

2. Do this.

inotify is intended to correct the deficiencies of dnotify, particularly
its inability to scale and its terrible user interface:

        * dnotify requires the opening of one fd per each directory
          that you intend to watch. This quickly results in too many
          open files and pins removable media, preventing unmount.
        * dnotify is directory-based. You only learn about changes to
          directories. Sure, a change to a file in a directory affects
          the directory, but you are then forced to keep a cache of
          stat structures.
        * dnotify's interface to user-space is awful.  Signals?

inotify provides a more usable, simple, powerful solution to file change
notification:

        * inotify's interface is a system call that returns a fd, not SIGIO.
	  You get a single fd, which is select()-able.
        * inotify has an event that says ""the filesystem that the item
          you were watching is on was unmounted.""
        * inotify can watch directories or files.

Inotify is currently used by Beagle (a desktop search infrastructure),
Gamin (a FAM replacement), and other projects.

Pull strscpy string copy function implementation from Chris Metcalf.

Chris sent this during the merge window, but I waffled back and forth on
the pull request, which is why it's going in only now.

The new ""strscpy()"" function is definitely easier to use and more secure
than either strncpy() or strlcpy(), both of which are horrible nasty
interfaces that have serious and irredeemable problems.

strncpy() has a useless return value, and doesn't NUL-terminate an
overlong result.  To make matters worse, it pads a short result with
zeroes, which is a performance disaster if you have big buffers.

strlcpy(), by contrast, is a mis-designed ""fix"" for strlcpy(), lacking
the insane NUL padding, but having a differently broken return value
which returns the original length of the source string.  Which means
that it will read characters past the count from the source buffer, and
you have to trust the source to be properly terminated.  It also makes
error handling fragile, since the test for overflow is unnecessarily
subtle.

strscpy() avoids both these problems, guaranteeing the NUL termination
(but not excessive padding) if the destination size wasn't zero, and
making the overflow condition very obvious by returning -E2BIG.  It also
doesn't read past the size of the source, and can thus be used for
untrusted source data too.

So why did I waffle about this for so long?

Every time we introduce a new-and-improved interface, people start doing
these interminable series of trivial conversion patches.

And every time that happens, somebody does some silly mistake, and the
conversion patch to the improved interface actually makes things worse.
Because the patch is mindnumbing and trivial, nobody has the attention
span to look at it carefully, and it's usually done over large swatches
of source code which means that not every conversion gets tested.

So I'm pulling the strscpy() support because it *is* a better interface.
But I will refuse to pull mindless conversion patches.  Use this in
places where it makes sense, but don't do trivial patches to fix things
that aren't actually known to be broken.

The result of this last form slipping through was some confusing logic
in IsStandardConversion handling of these resolved address-of
expressions which eventually exploded in an assert. Simplify this logic
a bit and add some more aggressive asserts to catch improperly formed
expressions getting into this routine.

Finally add systematic testing of member functions, both static and
non-static, in the various forms they can take. One of these is
essentially PR9563, and this commit fixes the crash in that PR. However,
the diagnostics for this are still pretty terrible. We at least are now
accepting the correct constructs and rejecting the invalid ones rather
than accepting invalid or crashing as before.

Credentials for hosting service accounts don't change very often, but
when they do, we don't provide any sane way of resetting/editing them.
The workaround before was to nuke the account data in the database
editor and then re-edit a repository, but this was pretty terrible.

We now have an ""Edit credentials"" link next to the selected account in
the repository configuration form. When clicked, the auth form will
appear, allowing the user to provide new credentials to use.

The user can cancel editing, or they can save the repository to
re-authenticate.

Testing Done:
Tested saving new credentials for an account.

Tested attempting to save bad new credentials, and seeing the error
message (with the form staying open).

Tested saving new credentials that then required a 2FA token (with the
form staying open).

Tested canceling edit.

Tested edit mode and then switching accounts/services.

Signed-off-by: ArenaL5 <a0f294373aec8f95bbade03118d15ff01c3c6d08@gmx.com>

Add method to select a layout directly

using the Super key + the numeric keypad. This method uses the layout list from the currently selected tag in the currently focused screen. (If there is no selected tag, it does nothing.)

To allow this, the keygroups `numpad` and `fkeys` were added to `awful.key.keygroups`.

Refit to avoid error by nil and to remove imperative code, as per recommendation from @Elv13.

awful.key() calls.

In _scsih_probe, delay the call to scsi_add_host until the host has been
fully set up.

Otherwise, the default .can_queue value of 1 causes scsi-mq to set the block
layer request queue size to its minimum size, resulting in awful performance.

In _scsih_probe error handling, call mpt3sas_base_detach rather than
scsi_remove_host to properly clean up in reverse order.

Wrangler and owner of angry pet geese and other angry birds here.

People think geese are assholes, and they are. But they are predictable assholes who understand certain body language. Here's some advice:

Don't:

• ⁠Break eye contact: Eye contact is super important to geese and if you look away, they take it as a sign of weakness and an invitation to attack and dominate you. Wearing sunglasses also counts as being a wimp, to a goose. • ⁠Run away: Don't turn away or try to run away for the same reasons as above, the goose will take it as a sign you are afraid and attack. • ⁠Be silent: Geese talk to each other all the time to tell each other where they are and what's going on. They are freaked out by silence. Talking in a normal tone might reassure them that you aren't a threat • ⁠Back down: If they come at you, don't back down! Fight that asshole goose, or it will be emboldened to keep attacking you or others

Do:

• ⁠Spread your arms out: You look bigger and it's a gesture of aggression (geese open their wings slightly before fighting) and if you advance on them like that they may back down • ⁠Hiss: This is aggressive and they might decide to back down • ⁠If they come at you, grab them by the neck: Geese totally hate being grabbed by the neck. Don't grab and squeeze, just grab lightly and they'll get freaked out and run away • ⁠Grab their beak: If you're coordinated enough you can grab them by the beak when they come into bite you too, they also hate this. Bonus if you get them with their beak open, geese tongues are cool to touch • ⁠Stand slightly to the side to avoid being punched by their wing... wrists? They love to come in swinging with their wings after grabbing you, but if you stand slightly to the side while hanging on to their beak/neck, they can't catch you straight on with their wing punches

Also remember you're a person and it's just a goose. The worst thing it can do is nip you with its beak or wing punch you, which doesn't even really hurt!

Once you start to notice the habits and body language of geese, you can actually end most conflicts peacefully without having to fight. Even my most aggressive gander was a sweetheart if you just communicated with him in the right way. Sometimes he was totally just trying to start shit to look dominant though, and then I had to pin him down and sit on him until he calmed down, otherwise he'd just keep punching me with his wings. What a lovable dick, I miss him.",,1,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,8,8,0,0,21530,4cdf03b54c7746b4e9d4220abbf03cc43daa4b36,2019-03-02 11:45:52 UTC,FALSE

Calling `awful.placement.no_offscreen` makes sure that it is fully

After a gpu reset we need to re-init some of the hw state we only
initialize when modeset is enabled, like rc6, hw contexts or render/GT
core clock gating and workaround register settings.

Note that this patch has a small change in the resume code:
- rc6 on gen6+ is only restored for the modeset case (for more
  consistency with other callsites). This is no problem because recent
  kernels refuse to load drm/i915 without kms on gen6+
- rc6/emon on ilk is only restored for the modeset case. This is no
  problem because rc6 is disabled by default on ilk, and ums on ilk
  has never really been a supported option outside of horrible rhel
  backports.

v2: Chris Wilson noticed that we not only fail to restore the clock
gating settings after gpu reset.

v3: Move the call to modeset_init_hw in _reset out of the
struct_mutext protected area - other callers don't hold it, too.

We have a few places where we register license state listeners on
transient components (i.e., resources that can be open and closed during
the lifecycle of the server). In one case (the opt-out query cache) we
were never removing the registered listener, effectively a terrible
memory leak. In another case, we were not un-registered the listener
that we registered, since we were not referencing the same instance of
Runnable. This commit does two things:
  - introduces a marker interface LicenseStateListener so that it is
    easier to identify these listeners in the codebase and avoid classes
    that need to register a license state listener from having to
    implement Runnable which carries a different semantic meaning than
    we want here
  - fixes the two places where we are currently leaking license state
    listeners

Important detail I didn't mention in the commit title:
we're now back using PostgreSQL full-text fuzzy
search but only on article titles. It seems like
something's fucked up with the indexing on the
content column which makes fuzzy searching on it
not work properly. Besides in order for fuzzy search to
make sense from the end-user perspective we'd have
to find a way to give them a preview of the section of
content that matched otherwise it's very hard to tell
which match contains what they're looking for since
we only show them the article titles in search results.

Previously, users of setuptools would get our data embedded in eggs.
Eggs are horrible things, but more importantly our package data should
be free, in a well-known albeit system-dependant path that is
independent of the package.

By specifying [install_data][1] as an alias of install, we assure that
our data (examples, integrations, etc) are placed in $data/share as
$DEITY intended.

Alternative suggestions included force-adding ""--old-and-unmanageable"",
which would invoke the distutils-style install command, but that had the
unfortunate side effect of turning off eggs and dependency resolution
altogether.

We could also use ""--single-version-externally-managed"", but I think
that was designed to be used by package managers, not by us.

In any case, both of the above were fragile and might break if the user
specified additional options to setup.py.

In closing, Python module management is horrible. See [this][2],
[this][3], and [this][4] for info about the status quo, and [this][5]
for information about crack to be smoked later down the road. Don't even
get me started about [PEP 427 -- Python wheels][6].

terrible solution either.

small set of popular games.

Discard policy uses ack_notifiers to prevent injection of PIT interrupts
before EOI from the last one.

This patch changes the policy to always try to deliver the interrupt,
which makes a difference when its vector is in ISR.
Old implementation would drop the interrupt, but proposed one injects to
IRR, like real hardware would.

The old policy breaks legacy NMI watchdogs, where PIT is used through
virtual wire (LVT0): PIT never sends an interrupt before receiving EOI,
thus a guest deadlock with disabled interrupts will stop NMIs.

Note that NMI doesn't do EOI, so PIT also had to send a normal interrupt
through IOAPIC.  (KVM's PIT is deeply rotten and luckily not used much
in modern systems.)

Even though there is a chance of regressions, I think we can fix the
LVT0 NMI bug without introducing a new tick policy.

Disable the SSH client tests on Windows

The tests haven't worked on Windows since PR #5352 landed and making them work there now has proved to be quite difficult, either involving the use of some terrible, unmaintable batch scripting or some major changes to the tests. Given that the tests only exercise the openssh based connections (as opposed to gocrypto) and that it's unlikely that openssh client software will actually be available on a windows client machine, we don't lose much by not running these test on Windows.

This was what was giving us terrible performance (~1 document/sec)
through single registration, as the documents were being submitted
individually and triggering a full CSV file read each time. The file is
only going to change on deployment, as it's currently implemented, so
there's no obvious risk to reading it all in on first use.

We're likely to revisit document boosting soon, so this may be removed
in its current form, but this was the simplest change that would give us
the performance we want.

I think Blob is a great midround antag. It provides a threat that forces the station to work together as a whole, adds excellent drama, and has a cool design. However, it's currently very weak. I think it needs both a buff of the core antag, and then some buffs/nerfs to bring all the different variants into line. This PR deals only with the former.

One thing blob is currently lacking in is kill power. To actually attack someone, or smash through a wall, takes a crippling amount of chemicals (usually 16-20). This means that if the blob fights back through spreading instead of factories it cripples itself. I believe attacking should be cheap to make blob a more dangerous enemy to fight, while not allowing it to reach critical mass more quickly while not in combat.

Re-rolls are very cool and make fighting blob more dynamic. They also help combat the current terrible balance between blob variants so RNG doesn't force you to watch yourself die to fire extinguishers. However, you have to pass up 80 chemicals to get one after your first. In fact, I believe any chemical cost makes re-rolling clunky to use - re-rolls work best as an attempt to throw off a crew that's beating you too easily, and sinking yourself into low points plays actively against that.

Reflector blobs are also rarely used. As they are now, you pay 15 points just to have a reflecting strong blob tile with 1/3rd health, and FOUR TIMES BRUTE DAMAGE. This means that the blob tile dies TWELVE TIMES quicker to brute than it did before! This buffs it to die a mere three times quicker to brute, and 1.5x quicker to burn.",,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,4,4,0,0,9947,126a671d75de88e78dd2ea874f64749071a22677,2018-12-22 13:16:05 UTC,FALSE

Since these aren't lexically in the constructor, drawing arrows would
be a horrible jump across the body of the class. We could still do
better here by skipping over unimportant initializers, but this at least
keeps everything within the body of the constructor.

""This patchset implements load_new_sstables, allowing one to move tables inside the
data directory of a CF, and then call ""nodetool refresh"" to start using them.

Keep in mind that for Cassandra, this is deemed an unsafe operation:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-6245

It is still for us something we should not recommend - unless the CF is totally
empty and not yet used, but we can do a much better job in the safety front.

To guarantee that, the process works in four steps:

1) All writes to this specific column family are disabled. This is a horrible thing to
   do, because dirty memory can grow much more than desired during this. Throughout out
   this implementation, we will try to keep the time during which the writes are disabled
   to its bare minimum.

   While disabling the writes, each shard will tell us about the highest generation number
   it has seen.

2) We will scan all tables that we haven't seen before. Those are any tables found in the
   CF datadir, that are higher than the highest generation number seen so far. We will link
   them to new generation numbers that are sequential to the ones we have so far, and end up
   with a new generation number that is returned to the next step

3) The generation number computed in the previous step is now propagated to all CFs, which
   guarantees that all further writes will pick generation numbers that won't conflict with
   the existing tables. Right after doing that, the writes are resumed.

4) The tables we found in step 2 are passed on to each of the CFs. They can now load those
   tables while operations to the CF proceed normally.""

Summary:
The symbols use the processor-specific SHN_AMDGPU_LDS section index
introduced with a previous change. The linker is then expected to resolve
relocations, which are also emitted.

Initially disabled for HSA and PAL environments until they have caught up
in terms of linker and runtime loader.

Some notes:

- The llvm.amdgcn.groupstaticsize intrinsics can no longer be lowered
  to a constant at compile times, which means some tests can no longer
  be applied.

  The current ""solution"" is a terrible hack, but the intrinsic isn't
  used by Mesa, so we can keep it for now.

- We no longer know the full LDS size per kernel at compile time, which
  means that we can no longer generate a relevant error message at
  compile time. It would be possible to add a check for the size of
  individual variables, but ultimately the linker will have to perform
  the final check.

We discussed shrinking/widening of selects in IR in D26556, and I'll try to get back to that
patch eventually. But I'm hoping that this transform is less iffy in the DAG where we can check
legality of the select that we want to produce.

A few things to note:

1. We can't wait until after legalization and do this generically because (at least in the x86
   tests from PR14657), we'll have PACKSS and bitcasts in the pattern.
2. This might benefit more of the SSE codegen if we lifted the legal-or-custom requirement, but
   that requires a closer look to make sure we don't end up worse.
3. There's a 'vblendv' opportunity that we're missing that results in andn/and/or in some cases. 
   That should be fixed next.
4. I'm assuming that AVX1 offers the worst of all worlds wrt uneven ISA support with multiple 
   legal vector sizes, but if there are other targets like that, we should add more tests.
5. There's a codegen miracle in the multi-BB tests from PR14657 (the gcc auto-vectorization tests):
   despite IR that is terrible for the target, this patch allows us to generate the optimal loop
   code because something post-ISEL is hoisting the splat extends above the vector loops.

* OCSP checks now verify the timestamps on the cert. updated unit tests, removed the verify_cb interface altogether.

* Start of x509 unit tests.

* Passing unit tests for cert chain validation. Still need to test ocsp and the host callback.

* Unit test that host name validation works and context is passed properly.

* Unit tests for OCSP, added some comments, and an ASN1 date parser. Moved around some reused code to testlib.

* Fixed some 'O Crap I forgot about that' stuff from looking at the PR. Nothing major.

* Addressed PR comments. Added more safety checks, cleaned up comments, made some variable names consistent.

* More PR updates. Cleaned up some comments and set error codes to safer defaults.

* Refactored clocks, updated s2nc and s2nd, reworked trust store to work with directories as well as ca files. Bug fixes after tests against live servers.

* Spare Colm the despair and self-loathing that would result from the c++ style comments he would need to call me out for. Removed some // style comments I noticed when reviewing the PR.

* Renamed clocks to monotonic and wall. Wrote some gates to handle boringssl not supporting ocsp validation.

* Added some tests for asn1 date parsing. Found a few bugs, fixed them. Trust store now can load locations multiple times, other msc. minor refactors.

* Secure is now the default. Also, trust store is automatically initialized to platform default paths. It's now an explicit call to disable client side validation. Unit test updates to handle new API.

* Updated usage guide with the x509 related API additions.

* Fixed compilation warnings in unit tests.

* Fixed some CI build (style failures), pulled asn1 time state machine into another function.

* Updates for Openssl 1.1.0, and fuzz test fixes.

* Added trust store to integration tests.

* Temporary strace and print of the commands being run for some hope of figuring out why trust store isn't working.

* Fixed typo in Travis config.

* Hail Mary.

* removed strace command, added current directory of python script as the working directory of the executable.

* Working directory should be directory not the actual filename.

* Fixed python arg passing that was breaking the test run.

* Ugh, another typo in python script.

* Added missing arguments for getopt_long for s2nd.

* got integration tests passing, by allowing partial chain if custom ca file is used.

* Test fixes. Added cleanup for static memory, updated libressl to later version (still needs to be uploaded to s3 bucket).

* additional commit to kick off CI.

* Appended libressl install path to bypass cache, memory leak fix, odd define issue on the build host wasn't picking up a symbol, added #define hack to work around it.

* Fixed idiotic read after free error.

* Fixed memory leak when set_config overwrites the connection's existing configuration.

* Addressed most CR comments. Updated libressl download path. The only part not done is the hostname validation which is still in discussion.

* Inverted auth, made hostname rejection the default for validation.

* Documentation update.

* Removed leftover flag.

* Addressed pr comments.

* moved some macros into s2n_openssl.h, after updating from master, used the S2N_ERROR_IF macro.

Some of the AMDGPU stack addressing modes require knowing the sign
bit is zero. We used to accomplish this by custom lowering
frame indexes, and then putting an AssertZext around a
TargetFrameIndex. This required specifically looking for
the AssextZext + frame index pattern which was moderately
disgusting. The same could probably be accomplished
with a target specific node, but would still
require special handling of frame indexes.

Summary:
Replace horrible hack with ok hack.

The main difficulty in implementing the disjunctive domain is to avoid
the quadratic time complexity of executing the same disjuncts over and
over again when going around loops:

First time around a loop, assuming for example a single disjunct `d`:

```
[d]
loop body
[d1' \/ d2']
```

Second time around the same loop: the new pre will be the join of the
posts of predecessor nodes, so `old_pre \/ post(loop,old_pre)`, i.e.
`d \/ d1' \/ d2'`. Now we need to execute `loop body` again
*without running the symbolic execution of `d` again* (and the time after
that we'll want to not execute `d`, `d1'`, or `d2'`).

Horrible hack (before): Disjuncts have a boolean ""visited"" attached
that does its best to keep track of whether a given disjunct is old or
new. When executing a single *instruction* look at the flag and skip the
state if it's old. Of course we have no way to know for sure so it turns
out it was often wrongly re-executing old disjuncts. This was also
producing the wrong results over even simple loops: only the last
iteration would make it outside the loop for some reason. Overall, the
semantics were pretty untractable and shady at best.

New hack (this diff): only run instructions of a given *node* on
disjuncts that are not physically equal to the ""pre"" ones already in the
invariant map for the current node.

This gives the correct result over simple loops and a nice performance
improvement in general (probably the old heuristic was hitting the
quadratic bad case more often).

The cached node mechanism provides a significant performance benefit for
allocations using a 32-bit DMA mask, but in the case of non-PCI devices
or where the 32-bit space is full, the loss of this benefit can be
significant - on large systems there can be many thousands of entries in
the tree, such that walking all the way down to find free space every
time becomes increasingly awful.

Maintain a similar cached node for the whole IOVA space as a superset of
the 32-bit space so that performance can remain much more consistent.

I noticed with my horrible snapshot excercisor that we were taking forever to
relocate the larger the file system got.  This appeared to be because we were
committing the transaction _constantly_.  There were a few places where we do
braindead things with metadata reservation, like start a transaction and then
try to refill the block rsv, which not only keeps us from committing a
transaction during the enospc stuff, but keeps us from doing some of the harder
flushing work which will make us more likely to need to commit the transaction.
We also were checking the block rsv and committing the transaction if the block
rsv was below a certain threshold, but we were doing this in a place where we
don't actually keep anything in the block rsv so this was always ending up false
so we always committed the transaction in this case.  I tested this to make sure
it didn't break anything, but it takes about 10 hours to get the box to this
state so I don't know how much of an impact it will really make.  Thanks,

Summary:
Add an SMLoc to CodeInit that records the source line it originated from.
This allows tablegen to point precisely at portions of code when reporting
errors within the CodeInit. For example, in the upcoming GlobalISel
combiner, it can report undefined expansions and point at the instance of
the expansion. This is achieved using something like:
  SMLoc::getFromPointer(SMLoc::getPointer() +
                        (StringRef - CodeInit::getValue()))

The location is lost when producing a CodeInit by string concatenation so
a fallback SMLoc is required (e.g. the Record::getLoc()) but that's pretty
rare for CodeInits.

There's a reasonable case for extending tracking of a couple other Init
objects, for example StringInit's are often parsed and it would be good to
point inside the string when reporting errors about that. However, location
tracking also harms de-duplication. This is fine for CodeInit where there's
only a few hundred of them (~160 for X86) and it may be worth it for
StringInit (~86k up to ~1.9M for roughly 15MB increase for X86).
However the origin tracking would be a _terrible_ idea for IntInit, BitInit,
and UnsetInit. I haven't measured either of those three but BitInit would
most likely be on the order of increasing the current 2 BitInit values up
to billions.

MSVC doesn't support passing by-value parameters with alignment of
16-bytes or higher apparantly. What is deeply confusing is that it seems
to *sometimes* (but not always) apply this to any type whose alignment
is set using __declspec(align(...)). This caused lots of errors when we switch
SmallVector over to use the automatically aligned character array
utilities as they used __declspec(align(...)) heavily.

As a pretty horrible but effective work-around, we instead cherry pick
the smallest alignment sizes with specific types that happen to have the
correct alignment, and then fall back to the attribute solution past
them. This should resolve the MSVC build errors folks have been hitting.
Sorry for that. In good news, it will do this without introducing other
UB I hope. =]

Currently, this pass only focuses on *trivial* loop unswitching. At that
reduced problem it remains significantly better than the current loop
unswitch:
- Old pass is worse than cubic complexity. New pass is (I think) linear.
- New pass is much simpler in its design by focusing on full unswitching. (See
  below for details on this).
- New pass doesn't carry state for thresholds between pass iterations.
- New pass doesn't carry state for correctness (both miscompile and
  infloop) between pass iterations.
- New pass produces substantially better code after unswitching.
- New pass can handle more trivial unswitch cases.
- New pass doesn't recompute the dominator tree for the entire function
  and instead incrementally updates it.

I've ported all of the trivial unswitching test cases from the old pass
to the new one to make sure that major functionality isn't lost in the
process. For several of the test cases I've worked to improve the
precision and rigor of the CHECKs, but for many I've just updated them
to handle the new IR produced.

My initial motivation was the fact that the old pass carried state in
very unreliable ways between pass iterations, and these mechansims were
incompatible with the new pass manager. However, I discovered many more
improvements to make along the way.

This pass makes two very significant assumptions that enable most of these
improvements:

1) Focus on *full* unswitching -- that is, completely removing whatever
   control flow construct is being unswitched from the loop. In the case
   of trivial unswitching, this means removing the trivial (exiting)
   edge. In non-trivial unswitching, this means removing the branch or
   switch itself. This is in opposition to *partial* unswitching where
   some part of the unswitched control flow remains in the loop. Partial
   unswitching only really applies to switches and to folded branches.
   These are very similar to full unrolling and partial unrolling. The
   full form is an effective canonicalization, the partial form needs
   a complex cost model, cannot be iterated, isn't canonicalizing, and
   should be a separate pass that runs very late (much like unrolling).

2) Leverage LLVM's Loop machinery to the fullest. The original unswitch
   dates from a time when a great deal of LLVM's loop infrastructure was
   missing, ineffective, and/or unreliable. As a consequence, a lot of
   complexity was added which we no longer need.

With these two overarching principles, I think we can build a fast and
effective unswitcher that fits in well in the new PM and in the
canonicalization pipeline. Some of the remaining functionality around
partial unswitching may not be relevant today (not many test cases or
benchmarks I can find) but if they are I'd like to add support for them
as a separate layer that runs very late in the pipeline.

Purely to make reviewing and introducing this code more manageable, I've
split this into first a trivial-unswitch-only pass and in the next patch
I'll add support for full non-trivial unswitching against a *fixed*
threshold, exactly like full unrolling. I even plan to re-use the
unrolling thresholds, as these are incredibly similar cost tradeoffs:
we're cloning a loop body in order to end up with simplified control
flow. We should only do that when the total growth is reasonably small.

One of the biggest changes with this pass compared to the previous one
is that previously, each individual trivial exiting edge from a switch
was unswitched separately as a branch. Now, we unswitch the entire
switch at once, with cases going to the various destinations. This lets
us unswitch multiple exiting edges in a single operation and also avoids
numerous extremely bad behaviors, where we would introduce 1000s of
branches to test for thousands of possible values, all of which would
take the exact same exit path bypassing the loop. Now we will use
a switch with 1000s of cases that can be efficiently lowered into
a jumptable. This avoids relying on somehow forming a switch out of the
branches or getting horrible code if that fails for any reason.

Another significant change is that this pass actively updates the CFG
based on unswitching. For trivial unswitching, this is actually very
easy because of the definition of loop simplified form. Doing this makes
the code coming out of loop unswitch dramatically more friendly. We
still should run loop-simplifycfg (at the least) after this to clean up,
but it will have to do a lot less work.

Finally, this pass makes much fewer attempts to simplify instructions
based on the unswitch. Something like loop-instsimplify, instcombine, or
GVN can be used to do increasingly powerful simplifications based on the
now dominating predicate. The old simplifications are things that
something like loop-instsimplify should get today or a very, very basic
loop-instcombine could get. Keeping that logic separate is a big
simplifying technique.

Most of the code in this pass that isn't in the old one has to do with
achieving specific goals:
- Updating the dominator tree as we go
- Unswitching all cases in a switch in a single step.

I think it is still shorter than just the trivial unswitching code in
the old pass despite having this functionality.

The goal of this refactoring effort was to better understand how interestingness
was propagated in BugReporter.cpp, which eventually turned out to be a dead end,
but with such a twist, I wouldn't even want to spoil it ahead of time. However,
I did get to learn a lot about how things are working in there.

In these series of patches, as well as cleaning up the code big time, I invite
you to study how BugReporter.cpp operates, and discuss how we could design this
file to reduce the horrible mess that it is.

This patch reverts a great part of rC162028, which holds the title ""Allow
multiple PathDiagnosticConsumers to be used with a BugReporter at the same
time."". This, however doesn't imply that there's any need for multiple ""layers""
or stacks of interesting symbols and regions, quite the contrary, I would argue
that we would like to generate the same amount of information for all output
types, and only process them differently.

replace default bolt option with sqlite3 option. the story here is that we
just need a working out of the box solution, and sqlite3 is just fine for that
(actually, likely better than bolt).

with sqlite3 supplanting bolt, we mostly have sql databases. so remove redis
and then we just have one package that has a `sql` implementation of the
`models.Datastore` and lean on sqlx to do query rewriting. this does mean
queries have to be formed a certain way and likely have to be ANSI-SQL (no
special features) but we weren't using them anyway and our base api is
basically done and we can easily extend this api as needed to only implement
certain methods in certain backends if we need to get cute.

* remove bolt & redis datastores (can still use as mqs)
* make sql queries work on all 3 (maybe?)
* remove bolt log store and use sqlite3
* shove the FnLog shit into the datastore shit for now (free pg/mysql logs...
just for demos, etc, not prod)
* fix up the docs to remove bolt references
* add sqlite3, sqlx dep
* fix up tests & mock stuff, make validator less insane
* remove put & get in datastore layer as nobody is using.

this passes tests which at least seem like they test all the different
backends. if we trust our tests then this seems to work great. (tests `make
docker-test-run-with-*` work now too)

Registering an existing namespace is neither an interesting event nor
a state change that should be logged in info log level. This is
unfortunate debug message that we see each time a domain is refreshed,
because of the horrible way domain objects are managed.

This change removes these useless logs from the default log level:

    Resource namespace 01_img_93404146-0d02-4d98-8310-f356733d7176 already registered (sd:658)

    Resource namespace 03_lvm_93404146-0d02-4d98-8310-f356733d7176 already registered (blockSD:874)

We need to check later if it is possible to avoid the registration in this
case, or maybe fix domain life cycle handling so we can register the namespace
after the previous instance unregistered it.

Bazel's VFS classes make the assumption that all filenames are encoded with latin-1. That theoretically allows roundtripping any sort of horrible byte pattern a Unix filesystem can produce through Bazel's Path class. This scheme falls apart, though, when trying to use the JDK I/O libraries. The filename encoding assumed by the JDK I/O libraries comes from the sun.jnu.encoding property, which can't be overriden with the normal -D JVM command line syntax. The Bazel client still tries quite hard to force this property to be latin-1: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/6641ad986f436926a75b31b47314c193a9a7e032/src/main/cpp/blaze.cc#L1467-L1473 But even a fusillade of 4 environmental variables is sometimes not enough. On macOS, the JDK simply hardcodes UTF-8 as sun.jnu.encoding. Even on Linux, if a the en_US.ISO-8859-1 locale isn't installed, glibc will fall back to an ASCII encoding. Since there's no public way to create a JDK FileOutputStream from either a byte[] filename or a raw file descriptor, I conclude the only workaround is to implement open() and write() in Bazel's unix_jni. This CL does that.

We should probably implement a native file InputStream, too, for completeness. However, as merely implementing OutputStream fixes the relevant issue, I'm only doing that in this CL.

Fixes https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7055.

Closes #7757.

Since production testing of `message_retention_days` is finished, we can
enable this feature in the organization settings page. We already had this
setting in frontend but it was bit rotten and not rendered in templates.

Here we replaced our past text-input based setting with a
dropdown-with-text-input setting approach which is more consistent with our
existing UI.

Along with frontend changes, we also incorporated a backend change to
handle making retention period forever. This change introduces a new
convertor `to_positive_or_allowed_int` which only allows positive integers
and an allowed value for settings like `message_retention_days` which can
be a positive integer or has the value `Realm.RETAIN_MESSAGE_FOREVER` when
we change the setting to retain message forever.

This change made `to_not_negative_int_or_none` redundant so removed it as
well.

Summary:
Aaron recently noticed that `hg log -p -l 1 fbcode/assistant` ran for a very
long time while it only produce one diff. The profile shows that most of the
time is spent collecting ancestors of files that involves lots of downloads.
Even when everything is cached locally, its run time is terrible at over 5min.

Looking at the profile, the code spent most of its time in the `populate`
function that tries to build the set of files present in a specific revision.
This operation has a O(N*M) complexity, with N the number of files, and M the
number of revisions per files.

To speed this up, we split the problem: 1) for individual files and 2) for
directories.

For 1), the user intention is to get correct history, so let's keep the code as
it is. For 2) let's simply match files in the given directory, with no
consideration for the revision or the ancestors.

As part of this, it turned out that the LifecycleWatcher was not following
its supposed behaviour (of reporting Dead machines, just once, in the first
event, lest their responsible entity entirely lose track of them), so I
fixed that... and noted to my disgust that those awful, awful tests didn't
even cover the case I changed. So I killed them all, and it felt Good.

parsing (and latent bug in the instruction definitions).

This is effectively a revert of r136287 which tried to address
a specific and narrow case of immediate operands failing to be accepted
by x86 instructions with a pretty heavy hammer: it introduced a new kind
of operand that behaved differently. All of that is removed with this
commit, but the test cases are both preserved and enhanced.

The core problem that r136287 and this commit are trying to handle is
that gas accepts both of the following instructions:

  insertps $192, %xmm0, %xmm1
  insertps $-64, %xmm0, %xmm1

These will encode to the same byte sequence, with the immediate
occupying an 8-bit entry. The first form was fixed by r136287 but that
broke the prior handling of the second form! =[ Ironically, we would
still emit the second form in some cases and then be unable to
re-assemble the output.

The reason why the first instruction failed to be handled is because
prior to r136287 the operands ere marked 'i32i8imm' which forces them to
be sign-extenable. Clearly, that won't work for 192 in a single byte.
However, making thim zero-extended or ""unsigned"" doesn't really address
the core issue either because it breaks negative immediates. The correct
fix is to make these operands 'i8imm' reflecting that they can be either
signed or unsigned but must be 8-bit immediates. This patch backs out
r136287 and then changes those places as well as some others to use
'i8imm' rather than one of the extended variants.

Naturally, this broke something else. The custom DAG nodes had to be
updated to have a much more accurate type constraint of an i8 node, and
a bunch of Pat immediates needed to be specified as i8 values.

The fallout didn't end there though. We also then ceased to be able to
match the instruction-specific intrinsics to the instructions so
modified. Digging, this is because they too used i32 rather than i8 in
their signature. So I've also switched those intrinsics to i8 arguments
in line with the instructions.

In order to make the intrinsic adjustments of course, I also had to add
auto upgrading for the intrinsics.

I suspect that the intrinsic argument types may have led everything down
this rabbit hole. Pretty happy with the result.

Some facts are aggregations of other facts. For example, we may compute how many times each macro is used in each object as a ""raw fact"":

  Dnnn uses macro ""psyduck"" 6 times.

But we want to present this data in aggregate form, e.g. ""order macros by popularity"". We can do this at runtime and it probably won't be too awful a query, but we can also aggregate it cheaply:

  Macro ""psyduck"" is used 3920 times across all objects.

...and then do a query like ""select macros ordered by usage"".

""Aggregate"" facts support facts like this. The aggregate facts I've implemented are:

  - Count of all objects.
  - Count of objects of type X.
  - Last time facts were updated.

These clearly fit the ""aggregate"" facts template well. I'm not 100% sure macros do. We can use this table to answer a question like ""What are the most popular macros, ordered by use?"" We can also use it to answer a question like ""What are the most popular macros in the last 6 months?"", if we build a specific fact for that. But we can't use it to answer a question like ""What are the most popular macros between times X and Y?"". Maybe that's important; maybe not.

This seems like a good fit for at least some types of facts.

I'll de-magic the keys a bit in the next diff.

Test Plan: Ran the engines and got some aggregated facts about other facts.

Mutating the global state of the autoloader... terrible idea. This should fix tests and remove the lines we were wondering about in the CI:
`Undefined index: remaining selfCount in [...]`

This is a nop. doesSectionRequireSymbols is only used from
isSymbolLinkerVisible. isSymbolLinkerVisible only use from ELF was in

if (!Asm.isSymbolLinkerVisible(Symbol) && !Symbol.isUndefined())
  return false;

if (Symbol.isTemporary())

If the symbol is a temporary this code returns false and it is irrelevant if
we take the first if or not. If the symbol is not a temporary,
Asm.isSymbolLinkerVisible returns true without ever calling
doesSectionRequireSymbols.

This was an horrible leftover from when support for ELF was first added.

When an ldom VM is bound, the network vswitch infrastructure is set up for
it, but was being forced 'UP' by the userland switch configuration script.
When 'UP' but not actually connected to a running VM, the ipv6 neighbor
probes fail (not a horrible thing) and start cluttering up the kernel logs.
Funny thing: these are debug messages that never actually show up, but
we do see the net_ratelimited messages that say N callbacks were
suppressed.

This patch defers the netif_carrier_on() until an actual link has been
established with the VM, as indicated by receiving an LDC_EVENT_UP from
the underlying LDC protocol.  Similarly, we take the link down when we
see the LDC_EVENT_RESET.  Now when we see the ndo_open(), we reset the
link to get things talking again.

libc++ is careful to not fracture overload sets. When one overload
is visible to a user, all of them should be. Anything less causes
subtle bugs and ODR violations.

Previously, in order to support ::abs and ::div being supplied by
both <cmath> and <cstdlib> we had to do awful things that make
<math.h> and <stdlib.h> have header cycles and be non-modular.
This really breaks with modules.

Specifically the problem was that in C++ ::abs introduces overloads
for floating point numbers, these overloads forward to ::fabs,
which are defined in math.h. Therefore ::abs needed to be in math.h
too. But this required stdlib.h to include math.h and math.h to
include stdlib.h.

To avoid these problems the definitions have been moved to stddef.h
(which math includes), and the floating point overloads of ::abs
have been changed to call __builtin_fabs, which both Clang and GCC
support.

it.

	Track assignments on import / from import statements – update references tests accordingly

437 Class view doesn't distinguish between same-named files in same project/different package
	Include the package name in addition to the project name when a module is duplicated by name.


506 Analyzer incorrectly inferring members for variables that are an intersection of two user types
	When creating a variable on a read treat the variable as ephemeral.  If types are added to an ephemeral variable latter via an assignment it’ll no longer be ephemeral.  Then when getting all of the members from a class/instance don’t include variables which are ephemeral and don’t have type information.

500 os.path is not understood to be the same as ntpath
	MultipleMemberInfo was missing an implementation of GetAllMembers.  path can be 1 of 3 different built-in modules even though we really only have type info on 1.

508 Stepping into print
	This only occurs after the 1st run – Python saves a .pyc file (or .pyo if running w/ the –O option) and then our filename checks to see if we’re in debugger code don’t work.  Change fixes our filename checks in several places and updates them to include .pyo files in addition to .pyc.

507 Step into may not step into the desired place
	When we do a step out we don’t deliver the event when we receive the return event.  Instead we deliver the event on the next line event.  This means stepping out leaves the cursor on the next line to execute.  But in this case we don’t get a next line event – we immediately go into a call event.  The next line event we receive at the correct depth is after we’ve processed the line.  So now we block immediately, so stepping out leaves the current line on the current line no matter what.  This seems to  match the other Python IDEs as well.


484 When Using ""lxml.etree._Element"", I cannot see ""Element""'s member in debugger
	We try and figure out if an object is a dictionary like based upon the presence of the “items’ key.  Element objects look an awful lot like dictionary objects but their items() returns attributes, which isn’t what you necessarily want to see.  So now we look for a “fromkeys” method as well to identify dictionary like methods.

Adds lipoplasty, plastic surgery and gender reassignment surgery.

Adds a var/target_must_be_fat to the surgery datum, for surgeries exclusive to fatties.
Adds a var/always_advance to the surgery step datum, for when it should advance to the next step even on failure.

Adds /proc/get_location_accessible(), which is used by surgery to make sure you have access to the area you're operating on.
It's a fairly horrible, but it's not called that often, so it should be fine. Correct me if I'm wrong.

Updated the changelog.

937bf4335 Use std::thread::hardware_concurrency, instead of Boost, to determine available cores (fanquake)

Pull request description:

  Following discussion on IRC about replacing Boost usage for detecting available system cores, I've opened this to collect some benchmarks + further discussion.

  The current method for detecting available cores was introduced in #6361.

  Recap of the IRC chat:
  ```
  21:14:08 fanquake: Since we seem to be giving Boost removal a good shot for 0.15, does anyone have suggestions for replacing GetNumCores?
  21:14:26 fanquake: There is std::thread::hardware_concurrency(), but that seems to count virtual cores, which I don't think we want.
  21:14:51 BlueMatt: fanquake: I doubt we'll do boost removal for 0.15
  21:14:58 BlueMatt: shit like BOOST_FOREACH, sure
  21:15:07 BlueMatt: but all of boost? doubtful, there are still things we need
  21:16:36 fanquake: Yea sorry, not the whole lot, but we can remove a decent chunk. Just looking into what else needs to be done to replace some of the less involved Boost usage.
  21:16:43 BlueMatt: fair
  21:17:14 wumpus: yes, it makes sense to plan ahead a bit, without immediately doing it
  21:18:12 wumpus: right, don't count virtual cores, that used to be the case but it makes no sense for our usage
  21:19:15 wumpus: it'd create a swarm of threads overwhelming any machine with hyperthreading (+accompanying thread stack overhead), for script validation, and there was no gain at all for that
  21:20:03 sipa: BlueMatt: don't worry, there is no hurry
  21:59:10 morcos: wumpus: i don't think that is correct
  21:59:24 morcos: suppose you have 4 cores (8 virtual cores)
  21:59:24 wumpus: fanquake: indeed seems that std has no equivalent to physical_concurrency, on any standard. That's annoying as it is non-trivial to implement
  21:59:35 morcos: i think running par=8 (if it let you) would be notably faster
  21:59:59 morcos: jeremyrubin and i discussed this at length a while back... i think i commented about it on irc at the time
  22:00:21 wumpus: morcos: I think the conclusion at the time was that it made no difference, but sure would make sense to benchmark
  22:00:39 morcos: perhaps historical testing on the virtual vs actual cores was polluted by concurrency issues that have now improved
  22:00:47 wumpus: I think there are not more ALUs, so there is not really a point in having more threads
  22:01:40 wumpus: hyperthreads are basically just a stored register state right?
  22:02:23 sipa: wumpus: yes but it helps the scheduler
  22:02:27 wumpus: in which case the only speedup using ""number of cores"" threads would give you is, possibly, excluding other software from running on the cores on the same time
  22:02:37 morcos: well this is where i get out of my depth
  22:02:50 sipa: if one of the threads is waiting on a read from ram, the other can use the arithmetic unit for example
  22:02:54 morcos: wumpus: i'm pretty sure though that the speed up is considerably more than what you might expect from that
  22:02:59 wumpus: sipa: ok, I back down, I didn't want to argue this at all
  22:03:35 morcos: the reason i haven't tested it myself, is the machine i usually use has 16 cores... so not easy due to remaining concurrency issues to get much more speedup
  22:03:36 wumpus: I'm fine with restoring it to number of virtual threads if that's faster
  22:03:54 morcos: we should have somene with 4 cores (and ￼ actually test it though, i agree
  22:03:58 sipa: i would expect (but we should benchmark...) that if 8 scriot validation threads instead of 4 on a quadcore hyperthreading is not faster, it's due to lock contention
  22:04:20 morcos: sipa: yeah thats my point, i think lock contention isn't that bad with 8 now
  22:04:22 wumpus: on 64-bit systems the additional thread overhead wouldn't be important at least
  22:04:23 gmaxwell: I previously benchmarked, a long time ago, it was faster.
  22:04:33 gmaxwell: (to use the HT core count)
  22:04:44 wumpus: why was this changed at all then?
  22:04:47 wumpus: I'm confused
  22:05:04 sipa: good question!
  22:05:06 gmaxwell: I had no idea we changed it.
  22:05:25 wumpus: sigh ￼
  22:05:54 gmaxwell: What PR changed it?
  22:06:51 gmaxwell: In any case, on 32-bit it's probably a good tradeoff... the extra ram overhead is worth avoiding.
  22:07:22 wumpus: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6361
  22:07:28 gmaxwell: PR 6461 btw.
  22:07:37 gmaxwell: er lol at least you got it right.
  22:07:45 wumpus: the complaint was that systems became unsuably slow when using that many thread
  22:07:51 wumpus: so at least I got one thing right, woohoo
  22:07:55 sipa: seems i even acked it!
  22:07:57 BlueMatt: wumpus: there are more alus
  22:08:38 BlueMatt: but we need to improve lock contention first
  22:08:40 morcos: anywya, i think in the past the lock contention made 8 threads regardless of cores a bit dicey.. now that is much better (although more still to be done)
  22:09:01 BlueMatt: or we can just merge #10192, thats fee
  22:09:04 gribble: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/10192 | Cache full script execution results in addition to signatures by TheBlueMatt · Pull Request #10192 · bitcoin/bitcoin · GitHub
  22:09:11 BlueMatt: s/fee/free/
  22:09:21 morcos: no, we do not need to improve lock contention first.   but we should probably do that before we increase the max beyond 16
  22:09:26 BlueMatt: then we can toss concurrency issues out the window and get more speedup anyway
  22:09:35 gmaxwell: wumpus: yea, well in QT I thought we also diminished the count by 1 or something?  but yes, if the motivation was to reduce how heavily the machine was used, thats fair.
  22:09:56 sipa: the benefit of using HT cores is certainly not a factor 2
  22:09:58 wumpus: gmaxwell: for the default I think this makes a lot of sense, yes
  22:10:10 gmaxwell: morcos: right now on my 24/28 physical core hosts going beyond 16 still reduces performance.
  22:10:11 wumpus: gmaxwell: do we also restrict the maximum par using this? that'd make less sense
  22:10:51 wumpus: if someone *wants* to use the virtual cores they should be able to by setting -par=
  22:10:51 sipa: *flies to US*
  22:10:52 BlueMatt: sipa: sure, but the shared cache helps us get more out of it than some others, as morcos points out
  22:11:30 BlueMatt: (because it means our thread contention issues are less)
  22:12:05 morcos: gmaxwell: yeah i've been bogged down in fee estimation as well (and the rest of life) for a while now.. otherwise i would have put more effort into jeremy's checkqueue
  22:12:36 BlueMatt: morcos: heh, well now you can do other stuff while the rest of us get bogged down in understanding fee estimation enough to review it ￼
  22:12:37 wumpus: [to answer my own question: no, the limit for par is MAX_SCRIPTCHECK_THREADS, or 16]
  22:12:54 morcos: but to me optimizing for more than 16 cores is pretty valuable as miners could use beefy machines and be less concerned by block validation time
  22:14:38 BlueMatt: morcos: i think you may be surprised by the number of mining pools that are on VPSes that do not have 16 cores ￼
  22:15:34 gmaxwell: I assume right now most of the time block validation is bogged in the parts that are not as concurrent. simple because caching makes the concurrent parts so fast. (and soon to hopefully increase with bluematt's patch)
  22:17:55 gmaxwell: improving sha2 speed, or transaction malloc overhead are probably bigger wins now for connection at the tip than parallelism beyond 16 (though I'd like that too).
  22:18:21 BlueMatt: sha2 speed is big
  22:18:27 morcos: yeah lots of things to do actually...
  22:18:57 gmaxwell: BlueMatt: might be a tiny bit less big if we didn't hash the block header 8 times for every block. ￼
  22:21:27 BlueMatt: ehh, probably, but I'm less rushed there
  22:21:43 BlueMatt: my new cache thing is about to add a bunch of hashing
  22:21:50 BlueMatt: 1 sha round per tx
  22:22:25 BlueMatt: and sigcache is obviously a ton

The ep->ovflist is a secondary ready-list to temporarily store events
that might occur when doing sproc without holding the ep->wq.lock.  This
accounts for every time we check for ready events and also send events
back to userspace; both callbacks, particularly the latter because of
copy_to_user, can account for a non-trivial time.

As such, the unlikely() check to see if the pointer is being used, seems
both misleading and sub-optimal.  In fact, we go to an awful lot of
trouble to sync both lists, and populating the ovflist is far from an
uncommon scenario.

For example, profiling a concurrent epoll_wait(2) benchmark, with
CONFIG_PROFILE_ANNOTATED_BRANCHES shows that for a two threads a 33%
incorrect rate was seen; and when incrementally increasing the number of
epoll instances (which is used, for example for multiple queuing load
balancing models), up to a 90% incorrect rate was seen.

Similarly, by deleting the prediction, 3% throughput boost was seen
across incremental threads.

more work since the interrupt handlers do an awful lot of reuse all

When a property is now set to a function, the function's return value will be
used for the value of the property. The function gets the new client as its only
argument.

There is no property which accepts a function as its value and thus this change
can't break anything (yeah, famous last words...).

This should fix half of FS#1011. Panels now don't get focused by awful.rules.

4086: withConfigurations takes a Trace parameter r=avieth a=avieth

## Description

To implement the Byron proxy, I use `withConfigurations` in order to get the configuration data. Previously, I was forced to use the `WithLogger` instance for `IO`, which is an aberration. With this change, I can give whatever `Trace IO Text` I want, for instance `noTrace`. Most importantly: it frees me up to use the `iohk-monitoring-framework` by way of a `Trace` which uses that.

I also had to update `getNodeParams`, and removed the outbound queue's use of `wlogTrace`, which had some fallout.

## To emphasize the problem

`WithLogger IO` was previously used (and still is used elsewhere) to give the logging implementation. This means that I, as a user of the library, have _no choice_ but to use whatever this instance decides for logging. In this case: `log-warper`, with a global uninitialized mutable variable. So my program crashes and I have no idea why.
Sure, I could make a `newtype` over `IO` to get away from it, but that's ridiculous, and only partially solves the problem: some things inside cardano-sl the library actually are pinned to the `CanLog IO` instance.
Solution: _do not use typeclasses for logging_. Ever. It's a terrible design. And if you ever think you need a global uninitialized `MVar` or `IORef`, you're probably doing it wrong.

user's selection spans multiple diff regions that are
impossible to combine in SideBySide. For example, the selection
can span a deletion chunk and an insertion chunk. In these
cases, we forcibly move the start line to the corresponding line
on the other side as if it were displayed on SideBySide. This is
a natural ""fix"" to the lousy selection made by the user and
probably reflects what the user means.

Note that range comments spanning multiple regions might cause
text that aren't actually part of the comment range to be
highlighted. For example, if the user puts a range comment that
spans the entire file, then every line will be highlighted in
Unified, even though the deletion chunks are technically not part
of the comment range. While we might be able to refine the
highlighting, it will need a more complicated implementation
that doesn't seem to worth the trouble.

This reverts commit 43858b4f25cf0adc5c2ca9cf5ce5fdf2532941e5.

The reason I removed the leave_mm() calls in question is because the
heuristic wasn't needed after that patch.  With the original version
of my PCID series, we never flushed a ""lazy cpu"" (i.e. a CPU running
kernel thread) due a flush on the loaded mm.

Unfortunately, that caused architectural issues, so now I've
reinstated these flushes on non-PCID systems in:

    commit b956575bed91 (""x86/mm: Flush more aggressively in lazy TLB mode"").

That, in turn, gives us a power management and occasionally
performance regression as compared to old kernels: a process that
goes into a deep idle state on a given CPU and gets its mm flushed
due to activity on a different CPU will wake the idle CPU.

Reinstate the old ugly heuristic: if a CPU goes into ACPI C3 or an
intel_idle state that is likely to cause a TLB flush gets its mm
switched to init_mm before going idle.

FWIW, this heuristic is lousy.  Whether we should change CR3 before
idle isn't a good hint except insofar as the performance hit is a bit
lower if the TLB is getting flushed by the idle code anyway.  What we
really want to know is whether we anticipate being idle long enough
that the mm is likely to be flushed before we wake up.  This is more a
matter of the expected latency than the idle state that gets chosen.
This heuristic also completely fails on systems that don't know
whether the TLB will be flushed (e.g. AMD systems?).  OTOH it may be a
bit obsolete anyway -- PCID systems don't presently benefit from this
heuristic at all.

We also shouldn't do this callback from innermost bit of the idle code
due to the RCU nastiness it causes.  All the information need is
available before rcu_idle_enter() needs to happen.

This patch reverses the order of fetching log from SAL and
checking poll threshold. This will fix following trivial issues:

- If SAL_GET_SATE_INFO is unbelievably slow (due to huge system
   or just its silly implementation) and if it takes more than
   1/5 sec, CMCI/CPEI will never switch to CMCP/CPEP.
- Assuming terrible flood of interrupt (continuous corrected
   errors let all CPUs enter to handler at once and bind them
   in it), CPUs will be serialized by IA64_LOG_LOCK(*).
   Now we check the poll threshold after the lock and log fetch,
   so we need to call SAL_GET_STATE_INFO (num_online_cpus() + 4)
   times in the worst case.
   if we can check the threshold before the lock, we can shut up
   interrupts quickly without waiting preceding log fetches, and
   the number of times will be reduced to (num_online_cpus()) in
   the same situation.

Fixes the mc getting all fucked up during midnight rollover

Mc now tracks the tick_usage of every subsystem, and will skip running an expensive subsystem if we are too close to overrunning in a tick, waiting until next tick, unless that subsystem is excessively past due (because we kept skipping it).

It now assumes that 20% of a tick should be saved for byond to do it's things, and stops running all subsystems once we get to 80% tick usage.

Dynamic wait will only smooth out wait changes over 8 fires if the new wait is lower than the old wait, before it would smooth out wait increases as well as decreases.

The fps throttle system is now 509 only.

The mc will now run every 1ds, no GCD bullshit, as we want to spread things out more.

The fix is obvious and the only test case I have is horrible, so I am
not including it. The problem shows up when self-hosting clang on i386
with -new-coalescer enabled.

Commit 87070ca introduced support for access keys in menus. Chosen
character was ""&"", an XML entity that has potential to cause problems;
if a user tries to add multiple access keys or just put an ampersand
in the name of the item the menu will break. Breaking happened because
ampersands were not escaped - first one was substituted and the rest
were ignored, but not escaped which triggered a pango markup error.

which would cause fastisel to bail out due to the first class aggregate load %1.  With
this patch we now compile it into the (still awful):

  %call = call i32 @_Z3foo9DeclGroup(i64 %2) noredzone ; <i32> [#uses=0]
  ret void

which doesn't bail out.  On CGStmt.ll, this reduces fastisel bail outs from 958 to 935,
and is the precursor of better things to come.

Introducing this API does not impact clients as it is mostly internal.

One reason for adding this API is because of ensureParentsByMerge used in a couple of places
which keeps checking if a parent node exists by reading a node to figure out if it exists. This is
fine for the InMemoryDataStore but it can be terrible in a distributed data store where the shard
which contains the data is remote. All sorts of overhead is associated with a remote read including
serialization which can actually be pretty expensive.

This is a horrible workaround for the lack of a spread operator in the V8 version we are currently using.
The super keyword has no way to pass a dynamic number of arguments without using the spread operator
but someone might reasonably want to use additional arguments in a regular subclass that is then
legacy-extended with a constructor property. This should at least protect against the majority of such
cases even if it creates a silly function signature.

Creating a new patron category raises an error ""An error occurred when updating
this patron category. Perhaps it already exists.""
DBIx::Class does not default to the value defined at the DB devel if the
key checkprevcheckout has been passed to the constructor.
We may need to provide a global fix for this kind of issue: if a column
is defined as ""not null"" but has a default value, the constructor
(Koha::Object->new) should not pass it to the DBIx::Class constructor
(even if assuming that null means default is a terrible mysqlism).

Test plan:
Create a new patron category.

Works as expected.

Apparently nvidia drivers magically don't like it when you ask for
the color space sdl asks for by default, which is r3g3b2.  And so
they feel free to do mysterious things like refuse to create a window
the first time you request it, then happily create a window afterwards
even if you request OpenGL 2.5, unless the first window you request is
OpenGL 1 or 2, at which point it works fine but who knows what the heck
it's giving you because it will happily lie.

This happened on Linux, confirmed across multiple people and graphics
cards.  I'd submit a bug to libsdl but I can't be arsed to make a
repro in C.

the conclusion is that the only place where the ports are reset to zero,
is from engine->cancel_requests called during i915_gem_set_wedged().

The race is horrible as it results from calling set-wedged on active HW
(the GPU reset failed) and as such we need to be careful as the HW state
changes beneath us. Fortunately, it's the same scary conditions as
affect normal reset, so we can reuse the same machinery to disable state
tracking as we clobber it.

The NetLabel secattr catmap functions, and the SELinux import/export
glue routines, were broken in many horrible ways and the SELinux glue
code fiddled with the NetLabel catmap structures in ways that we
probably shouldn't allow.  At some point this ""worked"", but that was
likely due to a bit of dumb luck and sub-par testing (both inflicted
by yours truly).  This patch corrects these problems by basically
gutting the code in favor of something less obtuse and restoring the
NetLabel abstractions in the SELinux catmap glue code.

Everything is working now, and if it decides to break itself in the
future this code will be much easier to debug than the code it
replaces.

One noteworthy side effect of the changes is that it is no longer
necessary to allocate a NetLabel catmap before calling one of the
NetLabel APIs to set a bit in the catmap.  NetLabel will automatically
allocate the catmap nodes when needed, resulting in less allocations
when the lowest bit is greater than 255 and less code in the LSMs.

Orientation EXIF tags are horrible, so we previously didn't respect them at

otherwise. Newer versions of Paperclip apply the auto-orient flag to the
convert statement by default, which was undoing our preference, so this change
gets rid of it again.

Moving events directly to the exec queue instead of the reordering
incoming queue, leaves holes in the sequence, that lead to timeouts for
all other events. Remove that part of the special handling.

(With netlink, events can't get out-of-order and the maximum timeout is 5
seconds and should not cause any trouble with the 10 sec timout for the
firmware class anyway. Events with timeouts are still prioritized for
execution, but don't bypass the incoming queue anymore.)

Currently, there are substantial problems forming vld1_dup even if the
VDUP survives legalization. The lack of an actual node
leads to terrible results: not only can we not form post-increment vld1_dup
instructions, but we form scalar pre-increment and post-increment
loads which force the loaded value into a GPR. This patch fixes that
by combining the vdup+load into an ARMISD node before DAGCombine
messes it up.

Also includes a crash fix for vld2_dup (see testcase @vld2dupi8_postinc_variable).

Recommiting with fix to avoid forming vld1dup if the type of the load
doesn't match the type of the vdup (see
https://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=31404).

This doesn't really change much, but feels more correct to do, as it
ensures that all messages currently queued in the bus connections are
definitely unreffed and thus destryoing of the connection object will
follow immediately.

Strictly speaking this change is entirely unnecessary, since nothing
else could have acquired a ref to the connection and queued a message
in, however, now that we have the new sd_bus_close_unref() helper it
makes a lot of sense to use it here, to ensure that whatever happens
nothing that might have been queued fucks with us.

Stand back.

Basic concepts:
* The difference between a dialog and an inspector is mostly to do with
  the window manager
* Sizing should be mostly symbolic and interpreted by the window manager
* Actions in windows should be abstracted by the window, so the child
  class doesn't dictate the location of the actions, only which ones are
  visible/available

Some definitions:
* Windows are now managed by a WindowManager
* Dialogs are windows with a title and an ActionSet
* ActionSets are dynamic selections of ActionWidgets that provide an
  abstraction between how the window wants to render actions and how the
  dialog interacts with them
* ActionWidgets are buttons with action and mode information
* ProcessDialogs are Dialogs with the title and safe and primary
  actions at the top and other actions in the foot
* MessageDialogs are Dialogs with all actions at the bottom in a
  column or row layout depending on available space, and a message in the
  body under the title

Some notes:
* When actions are clicked, getActionProcess is called and executed
* Actions are handled in getActionProcess and return a process that does
  something specific, otherwise they let the parent method take over,
  which will close the window safely
* Closing a window without any data is always the safe way, and won't
  (shouldn't) make any changes
* Dialogs should always use .next() in setup/ready and .first() in
  hold/teardown unless you have a very good reason otherwise (we don't
  have one yet)
* NodeDialog provides this.selectedNode between setup and teardown time
* ActionWidgets are available as this.actions within dialogs between setup
  and teardown time
* Window no longer emits any events

Primary Changes:
* OO.ui.WindowSet is now OO.ui.WindowManager, and it controls windows
* OO.ui.ProcessDialog is for complex dialogs and inherits
  OO.ui.Dialog
* OO.ui.MessageDialog is for alert/confirm dialogs and inherits
  OO.ui.Dialog
* OO.ui.Dialog provides a title label and actions API and inherits from OO.ui.Window
* OO.ui.ActionButton is a button used in dialogs to execute actions
* OO.ui.ActionSet manages OO.ui.ActionButton objects

Collateral damage:
* OO.ui.ButtonedElement frameless now framed with inverted value, plus a toggle method
* OO.ui.*Widget: hide and show merged into toggle
* OO.ui.PopuppableElement: showPopup and hidePopup are dead, use
  getPopup().toggle() instead
* OO.ui.Window: constructor config option ""title"" no longer supported, use
  static configuration or opening data instead
* OO.ui.Window: constructor config option ""icon"" no longer supported
* OO.ui.Window: static config ""icon"" is no longer used
* OO.ui.PopupWidget is sizable through config options
* OO.ui.PopupWidget: tail renamed to anchor
* OO.ui.PanelLayout has a little less padding
* OO.ui.PopupWidget
** Using overflow:hidden to avoid margin collapse
** Using z-index to avoid absolute or floating elements later in the DOM being on top
** Made $content config option end up in this.body instead of this.$element
** Fixed anchor alignment issues for left/right

When the dive list is cleared or updated, the entries in the
divesite-model become stale and therefore the divesite-model
(with the actual name LocationInformationModel) also must be
updated. This was done manually in some parts of the code and
forgotten in others. Therefore, do it directly in the clear()
and reset() function of the dive list-model.

This might be a bit of a layering violation: why should one
model call into another if they are not in parent/child
relationship? However, this seems easier than introducing
a global ""reset dives"" function that coordinates the models.

Moreover, it does not appear 100% safe: if the clearing of
the divesite model causes accesses to the divelist-model,
they happen in the midst of a model reset and we had horrible
bugs with that kind of things. However, I don't think that
should happen.

Static class_registries hinder librarification by requiring linking with
all object files (instead of a library from which objects are linked on
demand) and reduce readability by hiding dependencies and by their
horrible syntax. Hide them behind a non-static, non-template tracing
backend registry.

The ramstage is loaded from romstage, so the LZMA scratchpad buffer used
to decompress it is part of the romstage BSS in SRAM. On RK3288, SRAM
cannot be cached which makes the decompression so slow that it's faster
to just load an uncompressed image from SPI. Disable ramstage
compression on this SoC to account for that.

[pg: implementation avoids restructuring all of Kconfig]

BRANCH=None
BUG=None
TEST=Built for Pinky and Falco, confirmed that the former didn't have
COMPRESS_RAMSTAGE in its .config and the latter still did. Measured a
speed-up of about 35ms on Pinky. (For some weird reason, the
decompression of the payload also takes way longer than on other
platforms, although not as long as the ramstage. I have no explanation
for that and can't really think of a good way to figure it out... maybe
the Cortex-A12 is just terrible at some operation that LZMA uses a lot?)

This test, from CL 6198296 in 2008, ensured that an error injected
before the return of PackageFactory.parseBuildFile would not cause
PackageFactoryApparatus.createPackage to fail with an exception.

Although enthusiastically approved at the time by someone with the
same login name as me, this is not a style of test we want to
encourage, as it drills holes into lib.packages to support artificial
scenarios. It also requires a lot of support code.
Tests should be expressed in terms of stable interfaces.

Also:
- inline and delete PackageFactory.parseBuildFile.
  Enable option.recordScope in tests.
- delete ParsingTracker and ErrorReporter (part of above test,
  but artificially distanced from it by the awful Test/TestBase split).
- delete getEnvironmentExtensions() abstract method (always empty)
  and parameter of PackageFactoryApparatus
- delete assertOutputFileForRule method (dead code)
- delete getPathPrefix() (always empty)

As far as I can tell (it's hard to tell because it's entangled), we
only use this to render the thumbnails with the right rotation and
aspect ratio. So let's just do it as part of the thumbnail generation.

This should let us make other stuff less horrible. In particular, this
means that the this.uploads array now holds uploads in the same order
in which they were created (and in which they're shown in the interface),
which in turn results in UW uploading files in the same order, and
which allows us to remove some crappy sorting from elsewhere (added in
a37bba8dbc2e87b108c7e22c7ef0dabe847f07c5).

Bulk updates

Pending:
 - ~~renaming (update vs. request vs. query ...)~~
 - ~~proper logging (waiting for !250)~~
 - ~~`rrset_is_nsec3_rel()` and `mm_realloc` copypasta~~
 - partial zone adjustment - next MR

Pros:
 - faster for lots of small updates
 - improved terrible empty node cleanup (now takes time proportional to size of update, not size of the zone)
 - spinlocks instead of mutexes for ddns q access (faster for this case + less memory :fisted_hand_sign: )

Cons:
 - if one transfer fails (no matter the reason, except for acl issues), they all fail
 - might actually be slower for small singular updates, but oh well

Not sure if good or bad:
 - most of logging is lost (only logs errors in detail, i.e. who sent the faulty update)

We were keeping a reference to an object in a DenseMap then mutating it. At the end of the function we were attempting to clone that reference into other keys in the DenseMap, but DenseMap may well decide to resize its hashtable which would invalidate the reference!

It took an extremely complex testcase to catch this - many thanks to Zhendong Su for catching it in PR25225.

This fixes PR25225.

os-brick 1.6.1, so let's just remove it.

Summary:
Right now reserved words by Cython/Python not explicitly blocked by the thrift
compiler are appened with a single _,  This is better than not working at all
but its a horrible user experience because its automatic.  Instead a user can
pick a new name using the annotation ""py3.rename"".

I shortened the keywords list to those names not in the thrift lex grammer.
I also added names that I know cython doesn't allow as identifiers

ctr (which runs in the getty or ssh container) relies on sharing files in /tmp
with containerd (which runs in the host mount namespace). Specifically it
currently uses paths under /tmp/containerd for the stdio FIFOs of containers, resulting in:

    # ctr run -t docker.io/library/redis:alpine test
    ctr: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = runtime create failed: runc create failed: container with id exists: test

Currently it is not possible to specify a non-existent source directory for a
bind mount, so we cannot easily bind just /tmp/containerd. Sharing all of /tmp
doesn't sound like a terrible idea anyway.

Defering updating the sha in *.yml until after some further changes to these packages.

  on vlv, big thanks to Ville.
- Dynamic power well support for Haswell, shaves away a bit when only
  using the eDP port on pipe A (Paulo). Plus unclaimed register fixes
  uncovered by this.
- Clarifications of the gpu hang/reset state transitions, hopefully fixing
  a few spurious -EIO deaths in userspace.
- Haswell ELD fixes.
- Some more (pp)gtt cleanups from Ben.
- A few smaller things all over.

Plus all the stuff from the previous rather small pull request:
- Broadcast RBG improvements and reduced color range fixes from Ville.
- Ben is on a ""kill legacy gtt code for good"" spree, first pile of patches
  included.
- No-relocs and bo lut improvements for faster execbuf from Chris.
- Some refactorings from Imre.""

Summary:
Without this patch, the memory manager would call `mprotect` on every memory
region it ever allocated whenever it wanted to finalize memory (i.e. not just
the ones it just allocated). This caused terrible performance problems for
long running memory managers. In one particular compile heavy julia benchmark,
we were spending 50% of time in `mprotect` if running under MCJIT.

Fix this by splitting allocated memory blocks into those on which memory
permissions have been set and those on which they haven't and only running
`mprotect` on the latter.

Background:
Images that are stored in the cache folder will be stored in a folder whose
name is the image ID. In the event that an image is discovered to be no longer
used then a timestamp will be added to the image folder.
At each aging iteration we check if the image can be aged.
This is done by comparing the current nova compute time to the time embedded
in the timestamp. If the time exceeds the configured aging time then
the parent folder, that is the image ID folder, will be deleted.
That effectively ages the cached image.
If an image is used then the timestamps will be deleted.

When accessing a timestamp we make use of locking. This ensures that aging
will not delete an image during the spawn operation. When spawning
the timestamp folder will be locked and the timestamps will be purged.
This will ensure that a image is not deleted during the spawn.

In order to ensure that there is not a race between compute nodes each
compute node will have its own cache directory on the VMware datastore.

This is terrible costly when using more than one compute node (which is
a MUST for HA).

Due to the fact that we are using a nova lock utils if the compute nodes
have a shared file system then the locking is valid for all compute nodes.
In order to enable an administrator this option we provide a new
configuration parameter to enable multiple compute nodes to use the same
cache folder on the backend datastore. NOTE that this can only be done
when the compute nodes are running on the same host or the compute nodes
have a shared file system.

Summary:
In CUDA compilation, we call isInlineDefinitionExternallyVisible (via
getGVALinkageForFunction) on functions while parsing their definitions.

At the point in time when we call getGVALinkageForFunction, we haven't
yet added the body to the function, so we trip this assert.  But as far
as I can tell, this is harmless.

To work around this, we add a new flag to FunctionDecl, ""WillHaveBody"".

There was other code that was working around the existing assert with a
really awful hack -- this change lets us get rid of that hack.

First round of IIO new device support, features and cleanups for the 4.8 cycle.

New device support
* ads1015
  - add ads1115 support
* bma220 accelerometer
  - new driver
  - triggered buffer support.
* bmc150
  - add bmm150 support.
* bmp280
  - bme280 support with addition of humidity channel.
* max5487 potentiometer
  - new driver
* MMA7660FC accelerometer.
  - New driver
* st-pressure
  - support for the lps22hb
* loop trigger.
  - This one is *nasty* but we have real applications (parrot drones) where
  it is useful.  The trigger basically spins as hard as it can firing off
  a new trigger each time all triggered devices come back to say they are
  done.  It doesn't hang a machine even when doing it on a dummy driver.
  A lot nicer than having this implemented within lots of device drivers
  anyway.

Core stuff
* Add support to create IIO devices via configfs (similar to we did for
triggers a while back) + docs.
* New channel types
  - IIO_ELECTRICAL_CONDUCTIVITY
* Couple of MAINTAINERS patches to list the device tree bindings.
* Make trigger ops structure non optional (comment fix). It hasn't been for
an awful long time, but that's not what the description said.

New features
* ak8975
  - support adapters that are limited to byte data only by allowing the
  emulated block read i2c function that was recently introduced.
* atlas-ph
  - support atlas-ec (electrical conductivity sensor)
* bmi160
  - add available frequency and scale attributes to make the driver
  more user friendly (and avoid having to read the datasheet to know
  what will work).
* dummy
  - move creation to configfs interface.  It's not real hardware so we
  are not that worried about the ABI breakage ;)
* mma8452
  - oversampling ration support
* nau7802
  - expose available gains to make life easier for userspace.
* st-sensors
  - allow use of emulation for SMBus block reads as all the st parts support
  it.
* ti-ads1015
  - list datasheet names to allow their use by inkernel consumers.
* Various module alias additions to help auto probing.  Drop one redundant one
as well.

Cleanups
* ad7266, ad7476, ad7887, ad7923, ad799x
  - use direct mode claim function rather than open coding it during sensor
  read (prevents switching on buffers mid read).
* ad7793, ad7791
  - use direct mode claim to prevent frequency changes when buffers running.
* afe440x - These are ABI breaking but the driver requires custom userspace
  code to do anything useful anyway and that is still being written and under
  control of TI.  Ultimately we may have other libraries to do pulse
  oximetry with these devices but we aren't aware of any yet.
  - kernel-doc format fixes
  - drop ifdef fun around of_match_ptr - it's not worth the mess to save
  a tiny amount of space.
  - drop some unnecessary register initializations.
  - drop the weird locked gain modes as they gain us nothing (can just set
  all gains separately).
  - remove handling of offset attributes seeing as no channels actually have
  them (oops)
  - Drop the LED3 input channel as it's an alias for ALED2.
  - *big one* remove channel names - an experiment that turned out to not
  make sense - see patch for details.
  - use regmap fields to clean up code.
  - tie the tia gain stages to appropriate channels in the ABI as that is
  what they really effect. Same with the LED currents.
  - cleanout some unused defines and fix a missnamed one.
* atlas-ph
  - reorganise to allow support of other similar parts.
* bmc150
  - document supported chips in kconfig help.
* jsa1212
  - drop an unneeded i2c functionality check for functionality the driver
  doesn't use.
* mxs-lradc
  - simply touch screen registration code.
  - remove the touch screen unregister as all devm based now.
  - disable only those channels that are masked in hardware stop (others
  are already dealt with elsewhere)
* st-sensors
  - unexport st_sensors_get_buffer_element as nothing outside the st-sensors
  core driver uses it.
  - fix handling of failure to start up regulators.
* tpl0102
  - drop an i2c functionality test for features that aren't needed.
* ti-am335x
  - use variable name rather than type in sizeof for clarity.
  - use SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS helper macro to tidy up a bit.

Tools
* Add install / uninstall to makefile.  Someone cares, so presumably
some people will find it useful!
*  generic_buffer
   - rename to iio_generic_buffer to line up with other tools.
   - handle cleanup when receiving signals
   - Add a --device-num option and a --trigger-num option rather than
   relying on naming which doesn't work if you have two of the same part.

token chains first.  For this C function:

int test() {
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i < 100000; ++i)
    foo();
}

Instead of emitting this (condition before call)

.LBB_test_1:    ; no_exit
        addi r30, r30, 1
        lis r2, 1
        ori r2, r2, 34464
        cmpw cr2, r30, r2
        bl L_foo$stub

Emit this:

.LBB_test_1:    ; no_exit
        bl L_foo$stub
        addi r30, r30, 1
        lis r2, 1

        cmpw cr0, r30, r2
        bne cr0, .LBB_test_1    ; no_exit

Which makes it so we don't have to save/restore cr2 in the prolog/epilog of
the function.

This also makes the code much more similar to what the pattern isel produces.

We now get the result more type safe, with:

  %tmp1 = bitcast %struct.foo* %retval to i8*     ; <i8*> [#uses=1]
  %tmp2 = bitcast %struct.foo* %tmp to i8*        ; <i8*> [#uses=1]
  call void @llvm.memcpy.p0i8.p0i8.i64(i8* %tmp1, i8* %tmp2, i64 16, i32 8, i1 false)
  %0 = load %struct.foo* %retval                  ; <%struct.foo> [#uses=1]
  ret %struct.foo %0
}

That memcpy is completely terrible, but I don't know how to fix it.

Some long forgotten changes from the linux-mac68k CVS:

Remove the slot 0 (ROM) probing.
Remove the pointless White Screen Of Death crap.

The original commit is here:

http://linux-mac68k.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/linux-mac68k/linux-mac68k/drivers/nubus/nubus.c?r1=1.22.2.1&r2=1.22.2.2&pathrev=linux-2_2

This is mostly dead code removal. It is also a reversion to the
pre-v2.3.17 version. The old code was thoroughly tested in Debian Sarge.

The present code for probing fake slot resources in Apple's on-board
(slot zero) ROMs could be useful if replaced the macintosh_config struct.
But it can't do so and we don't want two mechanisms for identifying
on-board hardware.

Previously, we had one thread per stream, which is terrible for
performance but simple. In this patch, a per-TLS thread completion
thread is setup by the AsyncClientManager and shared amongst all clients
(and streams). There is now somewhat complex cross-thread shared state
(including some narrow locked sections) to deal with stream shutdown
during inflight operations.

Risk Level: Low (only Google gRPC client impacted, not in prod use).
Testing:  existing tests, with --runs_per_test=1000 for {grpc_client_integration_test,ads_integration_test,metrics_service_integration_Test}. Also added some new unit tests for Google gRPC client call creation in google_async_client_impl_test and client destruction in grpc_client_integration_test.

* fix(swagger): Exclude MetaClass from swagger model generation

All groovy classes have an implicit metaClass field that handles
metaprogramming. In cases where a groovy class is used in an
API the springfox library to generate Swagger docs is including
the metaClass in the model for the class. In addition to being
confusing (as a producer/consumer of the API would never set
that field), it also leads to terrible performance in some
cases.

The performance issues come from the fact that it then tries to
build a model of MetaClass by reflecting its fields, etc. until
it has built models of most of the Groovy classes.

In particular, before this change, front50 took 140 seconds to start;
with this change it now takes 13 seconds.

* fix(swagger): Make groovy implementation dependency

This does not need to be an API dependency.

* fix(swagger): Only bring in core groovy

We don't need all of it, only the core

Come, let me tell you a story of the old days----of SHITCODE.

AGhhhhh.

Once upon a time, SS13 code was terrible (who are we joking, it still 
is, but that's a story for another day), and when any carbon subtype, 
minus humans, talked over radio, it would runtime.

Of course, coders set about fixing this problem---can't have nonsense 
like that, so...of course, the most logical thing was done.

Instead of solving the awfulness that was not only using the wrong 
istype check and a wonderful colon override as well: 
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/blob/9eb0e80ae7f57040b9178c637efb4bac33ce3d16/code/game/objects/radio/radio.dm#L148

A ""Fix"" was applied instead: 
https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation/commit/9eb0e80ae7f57040b9178c637efb4bac33ce3d16#diff-b5f801c8078b7d8dd9f0661b359dfa9e

Whereby `var/obj/item/card/id/wear_id = null` was added to monkeys and 
aliens to ""fix"" them having an ID holder and not throwing a 
runtime.........Thus ensuring:

Fox would find it one day and call this utterly moronic and while also 
ensuring that all future carbon mobs created without implementing this 
same ""fix"" would have the same exact problem.

Then radio code got rewritten to be non-stupid and this still hung 
around until today.

Refs #3929

Optionally enables O_DSYNC mode for segment files, and when
enabled ignores actual flushing and just barriers any ongoing
writes.

Iff using O_DSYNC mode, we will not only truncate the file
to max size, but also do an actual initial write of zero:s
to it, since XFS (intended target) has observably less good
behaviour on non-physical file blocks. Once written (and maybe
recycled) we should have rather satisfying throughput on writes.

Note that the O_DSYNC behaviour is hidden behind a default
disabled option. While user should probably seldom worry about
this, we should add some sort of logic i main/init that unless
specified by user, evaluates the commitlog disk and sets this
to true if it is using XFS and looks ok. This is because using
O_DSYNC on things like EXT4 etc has quite horrible performance.

All above statements about performance and O_DSYNC behaviour
are based on a sampling of benchmark results (modified fsqual)
on a statistically non-ssignificant selection of disks. However,
at least there the observed behaviour is a rather large
difference between ::fallocate:ed disk area vs. actually written
using O_DSYNC on XFS, and O_DSYNC on EXT4.

Note also that measurements on O_DSYNC vs. no O_DSYNC does not
take into account the wall-clock time of doing manual disk flush.
This is intentionally ignored, since in the commitlog case, at
least using periodic mode, flushes are relatively rare.

In e0fce7e, jonas054 adjusted autocorrection to only correct a single offense
at a time (rather than all offenses for a single cop) if the source file
contains tabs.

The comments indicate that autocorrecting files which contains tabs may be
problematic somehow, but it's hard to see how that is the case. All specs,
including the specs which were added in e0fce7e, still pass when the added
code is removed.

What prompted the addition of that code in the first place? It was made in
response to GH issue #1928. BUt all the ""problem"" code which was posted in that
thread is still autocorrected without problems, even when this ""fix"" is removed.

Why is removing this code desirable? Because, simply put, it flushes
autocorrection performance right down the toilet, and straight into the sewer.
It's hard to overstate how bad it is for perf. It takes what was just mildly
terrible and makes it appallingly, disastrously horrendous. And when I say
""horrendous"", what I mean is ""hideously atrocious"".

If we still have trouble with tabs, it would be better to do a pass which
replaces tabs first, before any other cops get a crack at autocorrection. But
it remains to be seen whether that is actually necessary.

This allows you to profile shit in a line by line fashion, getting a neat little report about how long (in milliseconds) was spent on what line(s).

Only one can be running at a time. You just have to call PROFILE_START then call PROFILE_TICK between lines, and finally, use profile_show(mob/client) to show the profile results to a mob. Profiles are sorted by avg cost per run.

Cult is awful, so let's try to improve it. Idea by KorPhaeron. I also
took some inspiration from adrix89's sacrifice cult, so credits to him.
Also thanks a lot specially to MrPerson and Iamgoofball for helping
me brainstorm this, and Joan for the sprites for the summoning orb,
the large nar-sie shell, and the new cult antag hud.

Basically, we remove conversion, and turn cult into a magic version of
nuke, with a small team of stealth elite cultists that have to build a
base in the station and sacrifice people in order to build an army of
constructs and get materials to eventually summon Nar-Sie.

Stun talismans and conversion are gone. Nar-Sie is now the only
objective. Sacrifice runes now provide summoning orbs, which you can use
to drop a large shell. Insert enough orbs in the shell and you trigger a
Delta. Defend the shell for 3 minutes and Nar-sie will arise. This shell
is bombproof and singularityproof. It may be summoned up to three times
if destroyed, but you will have to start from the beginning sac-wise.

Runes are now RNG. Each cultist only gets 50% of the runes. Inspiration
is basically The Binding of Isaac here (thank you MrPerson for this!).
Furthermore, many old runes were merged/removed and other new ones were
added. Almost all were massively rebalanced. Cult now also has a
stealthy ritual dagger with high bleeding and throw effects.

This is a re-commit of r219977:

r219977 was reverted in r220038 because it hit a wrong-code bug in GCC 4.7.2.
(That's gcc.gnu.org/PR56135, and affects any implicit lambda-capture of
'this' within a template.)


r219977 was a re-commit of r217995, r218011, and r218053:

r217995 was reverted in r218058 because it hit a rejects-valid bug in MSVC.
(Incorrect overload resolution in the presence of using-declarations.)
It was re-committed in r219977 with a workaround for the MSVC rejects-valid.

r218011 was a workaround for an MSVC parser bug. (Incorrect desugaring of
unbraced range-based for loop).

The default `rc.lua` was using the focus/unfocus signals to set
the border color along with `awful.rules`. This logic block was
no longer aligned with the rest of `rc.lua` since it was
the only place where `beautiful` variables where only used by
`rc.lua`.

On top of this, the new request handler also has extra contexts
for the urgent and floating/maximixed use cases. So it can be used
by themes to implement much smarter borders than just focus based
ones. They were previously limited by the fact most of the
(un-monkey-patchable) logic was in `rc.lua`.

Note that this commit also shuffle the awful.rules order between
the titlebar and the border and changes the tests accordignly.
After some consideration, I came to the conclusion the previous
behavior was bogus and the fact that the placement tests required
to know about the titlebar height is simply a proof of that. The
change was required in this commit because since the border is no
longer in the default rules, a new buggy edge case surfaced.

Uniter context: export FlushContext

Most of the tests for finalizeContext, which is *complex* (not to mention complicated...) were invoking it by side-effect. So, it was really not well tested at all; to rectify this:

* context.Runner now uses a context.Context interface, not an explicit *HookContext
  * the finalizeContext method became FlushContext
  * the hookVars func became a HookVars method
  * the context ActionData method replaces an ad-hoc combination of similarly horrible access methods
* the various flush tests that depended on running a fake hook are now calling FlushContext directly; and slightly more than before, although (tbh) not *enough* by a long shot
* context.Runner.Run* methods are now tested using a mock context.Context, so we now have *actual tests* that the contexts get flushed

These require an explicit pointers to nvkm_object/nvkm_subdev/nvkm_device,
depending on which macros are used.  This is unlike the previous macros
which take a void *, and work for anything derived from nvkm_object (by
way of some awful heuristics).

The output will be a bit confused until everything has been transitioned,
as the logging format used is a more standard style that previously.

In addition, usage of pr_cont(), which doesn't work correctly with the
dev_*() printk functions (and was potentially racy to begin with), will
be replaced.

The (x,y) position of a client is outside of the border, but the width/height
does not include the border (so the real width is width+2*border).

This means that we have to also subtract 2*border to make sure that the client
including its border really is inside of the expected area.

Pull networking updates from David Miller:

 1) Make syn floods consume significantly less resources by

    a) Not pre-COW'ing routing metrics for SYN/ACKs
    b) Mirroring the device queue mapping of the SYN for the SYN/ACK
       reply.

    Both from Eric Dumazet.

 2) Fix calculation errors in Byte Queue Limiting, from Hiroaki SHIMODA.

 3) Validate the length requested when building a paged SKB for a
    socket, so we don't overrun the page vector accidently.  From Jason
    Wang.

 4) When netlabel is disabled, we abort all IP option processing when we
    see a CIPSO option.  This isn't the right thing to do, we should
    simply skip over it and continue processing the remaining options
    (if any).  Fix from Paul Moore.

 5) SRIOV fixes for the mellanox driver from Jack orgenstein and Marcel
    Apfelbaum.

 6) 8139cp enables the receiver before the ring address is properly
    programmed, which potentially lets the device crap over random
    memory.  Fix from Jason Wang.

 7) e1000/e1000e fixes for i217 RST handling, and an improper buffer
    address reference in jumbo RX frame processing from Bruce Allan and
    Sebastian Andrzej Siewior, respectively.

(I want to ensure that the only krb5_context variables created while

The pagination selector is pretty ugly and terrible at this point, and we'll
probably redesign this later, but for now, I'd like to keep it as-is but allow
it to update dynamically so we can load different revisions. This change moves
its rendering into javascript.

Testing done:
Set up a few different revisions with different pagination. Checked that the
pagination selector rendered appropriately in different cases, and that the
different links went to the right pages.

This adds a wrapper function and a Kconfig variable to differentiate
between SPI controllers which use atomic cycle sequencing versus
those where the transaction sequence is controlled manually. Currently
this boils down to x86 vs. non-x86.

Yes, it's hideous. The current API only worked because, for better or
worse, x86 platforms have been homogeneous in this regard since they
started using SPI as an alternative to FWH for boot flash. Now that
we have non-x86 platforms which use general purpose SPI controllers,
we should overhaul the entire SPI infrastructure to be more adaptable.

This reverts commit r283802. It introduces temporarily static
initializers, because StringRef ctor isn't (yet) constexpr for
string literals.
I plan to get there this week, but apparently GCC is so terrible
with these static initializer right now (10 min+ extra codegen
time was reported) that I'll hold on to this patch till the
constexpr one is ready, and land these at the same time.

Refactor the FileSystem class to include the hash function as an
instance field. This allows us to have a different hash function
per FileSystem and removes technical debt, as currently that's
somewhat accomplished by a horrible hack that has a static method
to set the hash function for all FileSystem instances.

The FileSystem's default hash function remains MD5.

* SSthrowing + callbacks!
Throwing is now a subsystem.
It's low priority, but is a ticker subsystem so is ran before most other subsystems.
To allow for shit to run after the throw finishes, throwing now supports a callback.
A callback datum system was created, conversion of addtimer is planned for another PR.
Throwing now has a limit of 2048 turfs (was 600)
Throwing now ticks every world.tick, and properly converts the speed arg from 1ds to what ever tick_lag is.
Throwing now properly accounts for missed ticks.
Throwing no longer uses sleep.
Throwing should no longer lag since it's not filling the sleep queue up

* Smoother tentacles

* Some improvements

* Missed a spot.

* Makes shit quicker.
Inlines the thrownthing.tick() proc.
Raises missed ticks value
Lowers max dist value
Inlines the two sister overrides for /atom/movable/Moved() because that just seemed like a waste

* >PRs open that use procs i'm removing.

* STOP THE PRESSES!

* throw_at now runs the first throw tick() immediately
This will help some with throwing while running.

* Item throwing now imparts the momentum of the user throwing.

(ie, running in the direction you are throwing makes you throw faster, running away from the direction you are throwing makes you throw the item slower)

* Moves throwing momentum from carbon/throw_item to movable/throw_at.
There are other things that cause a mob to ""throw"" an item, I figured we keep this universal since thrower is already an arg.

* Explosions throw shit faster.
This was stupid, ""Hey, lets set the item's throw_speed to 4 so embedding works, but lets make it throw at the base 2 throw speed for no reason.""

* Fixes explosion embedding.
This also acts as a nice example of how to override a callback in an override of throw_at properly.

The main goal was to remove all the pointless shit in the UI style dmis, but this commit actually goes a bit deeper than that.

Formally renames the ""hurt"" intent to ""harm"", in line with everything else in the world.

Removes the old screen1_... .dmis. They've been replaced with screen_... .dmis. They function much the same.
screen_gen.dmi is used for things which apply to multiple UI styles, such as storage slot sprites, or the intent selector. (These can still be overridden in HUD code, though.)

Item action buttons have been changed to use a template from the UI style, and the icon_state of the item.
var/icon_action_button has been removed- varvar/action_button_name must be used instead to add action buttons for items.

Summary:
Now we have most of Sema's code completion signals incorporated in Quality,
which will allow us to give consistent ranking to sema/index results.

Therefore we can/should stop using Sema priority as an explicit signal.
This fixes some issues like namespaces always having a terrible score.

The most important missing signals are:
 - Really dumb/rarely useful completions like:
    SomeStruct().^SomeStruct
    SomeStruct().^operator=
    SomeStruct().~SomeStruct()
   We already filter out destructors, this patch adds injected names and
   operators to that list.
 - type matching the expression context.
   Ilya has a plan to add this in a way that's compatible with indexes
   (design doc should be shared real soon now!)

If an error occurs while a layout is being applied, arrange_lock could
get stuck at true, meaning that no more re-arranges will happen, thus
breaking the whole layout machinery.

Such errors could happen because the layout itself produces an error,
but also because a width is too large and c:geometry() throws an error.
Thus, this commit moves all of the actual ""apply a layout""-code into a
protected context.

The way the locale font fallbacks work is:
- The font stack includes made up keywords (`x-locale-body`,
  `x-locale-heading-primary`, `x-locale-heading-secondary`)
- When the browser doesn't recognize the keywords it falls back
  to the next font in the stack
- We can load CSS files specific to each locale. In those files we can
  include an `@font-face` declaration which defines the keywords. This
  causes the defined font to be loaded and displayed.
- Best practice for Asian character sets (ie Chinese) is to load a
  preferred display font and then specify a better fallback for the
  Chinese. This is because Chinese fonts have English characters but
  they look terrible.

Changes in this PR:
- Removed the @font-face declaration for Zilla from the main.css file.
- Added made up keyword x-locale-heading-primary to the front of the
  heading font stack.
- Added made up keywords `x-locale-heading-secondary`, and
  `x-locale-body` to the font stack as fallback fonts
- Added locale specific files for each locale which Zilla supports.
  These files each include the Zilla @font-face declaration which
  enables Zilla to load into its place in the font stack.
- Because font paths are relative the SCSS variables are complicated.
  To handle loading Zilla from the locale files I had to move the
  Zilla files into the locale folder and the _zilla.scss file in with
  the other locale style sheets.
- Copied locale specific fixes for Open Sans from bedrock to kuma
  using the x-locale-body keyword to load in better fallbacks.
    - Did not copy font-variant fixes since we don't use font variants.
- Declared new heading defaults for locales with Arabic alphabet by
  defining a font-face for x-locale-heading-primary in those locale
  specific files.

Linus reported the following perf build system bug:

  'Another annoyance during that make was that ""make install"" seems to
   want to re-make the thing I just built. That's absolutely horrible, [...]'

The thing that got re-built were 'only' the (numerous) feature checks,
not the whole project - but still it was mighty annoying as the feature
checks took 9+ seconds even on reasonably fast boxes.

Even with the autodep patches where feature detection is much faster
it wastes resources, wastes screen real estate and confuses users if
we execute feature detection twice.

There were two sources for these unnecessary re-builds of the feature
checks:

 - Unnecessary nested invocations of $(MAKE), apparently to be able
   to do conditional compilation dependent on documentation tools
   presence. Use straight dependencies instead, with no nesting.

 - A direct invocation of $(MAKE) to rebuild the PERF-VERSION-FILE.
   This is apparently done to be able to include it into the
   Makefile:

    -include $(OUTPUT)PERF-VERSION-FILE

   but that's entirely pointless for two reasons: 1) the version file
   gets regenerated by the initial build pass anyway, 2) including it
   is futile, given its contents:

    #define PERF_VERSION ""3.12.rc3.g8510c7""

   'make' will interpret that as a comment line...

   So just remove this part of the doc-generation logic.

With these things fixed a 'make install' now rebuilds only what is needed.

A repeated 'make install' on an already built tree is super fast now,
it finishes in under 0.3 seconds:

  #
  #  After the patch:
  #

  $ time make install

  ...

  real    0m0.280s
  user    0m0.162s
  sys     0m0.054s

Prior all the autodep changes and prior this fix, a repeat 'make install'
took 24.1 seconds (!) on the same system:

  #
  #  Before the patches:
  #

  $ time make install

  ...

  real    0m24.109s
  user    0m21.171s
  sys     0m2.449s

Which almost entirely was caused by fixable build system fat.
We are now literally ~86 times faster.

A fresh rebuild and install now takes just 11.4 seconds:

  #
  #  After the patch:
  #

  $ make clean
  $ time make -j16 install

  ...

  real    0m11.457s
  user    1m43.411s
  sys     0m7.610s

Without the patches it took 27.8 seconds:

  #
  #  Before the patches:
  #

  $ make clean
  $ time make -j16 install

  ...

  real    0m27.801s
  user    1m59.242s
  sys     0m9.749s

So even in the complete rebuild case we are now ~2.5 times faster.

* Move out boot parameters to a separate struct, which is not part
  of SConfig/ConfigManager because there is no reason for it to
  be there.

* Move out file name parsing and constructing the appropriate params
  from paths to a separate function that does that, and only that.

* For every different boot type we support, add a proper struct with
  only the required parameters, with descriptive names and use
  std::variant to only store what we need.

* Clean up the bHLE_BS2 stuff which made no sense sometimes. Now
  instead of using bHLE_BS2 for two different things, both for storing
  the user config setting and as a runtime boot parameter,
  we simply replace the Disc boot params with BootParameters::IPL.

* Const correctness so it's clear what can or cannot update the config.

* Drop unused parameters and unneeded checks.

* Make a few checks a lot more concise. (Looking at you, extension
  checks for disc images.)

* Remove a mildly terrible workaround where we needed to pass an empty
  string in order to boot the GC IPL without any game inserted.
  (Not required anymore thanks to std::variant and std::optional.)

The motivation for this are multiple: cleaning up and being able to add
support for booting an installed NAND title. Without this change, it'd
be pretty much impossible to implement that.

Also, using std::visit with std::variant makes the compiler do
additional type checks: now we're guaranteed that the boot code will
handle all boot types and no invalid boot type will be possible.

Recently it was observed that with large numbers of volumes
that things like ""cinder list"" could take extremely long to
return.

For example, running cinder list on a system with 1000 volumes took
greater than 30 seconds to return.  It turns out that the cause of
this is the addition of visible admin_metadata.

There's two problems with this:
1. The original patch probably shouldn't have gone in
   data is either admin data or it's not, selectively picking
   pieces of admin data out to provide to the user just creates
   complications and introduces confusion.
2. The REAL issue here is that since the standar gets are made
   with the standard user context, the add_visible_admin_metadata
   would go through and do an elevated context get on every single
   volume individually.  This is what caused the horrible performance
   issue on cinder list with large numbers of volumes.

Running as admin, or removing the second call drops this down to about 3
seconds for the same 1000 volume list.

This patch removes the secondary admin context get_call.  Instead where
we expect to do display the visible admin_meta, we pass in a flag
requesting that the volume object we're getting has the appropriate
metadata.  This way we can elevate the context if needed and avoid
iterating through the gets again.

This patch also cleans up the get_visible_admin_meta methods, and
consolidates both V1 and V2 to use the utils method.

With the recent updates, blk-throttle is finally ready for proper
hierarchy support.  Dispatching now honors service_queue->parent_sq
and propagates correctly.  The only thing missing is setting
->parent_sq correctly so that throtl_grp hierarchy matches the cgroup
hierarchy.

This patch updates throtl_pd_init() such that service_queues form the
same hierarchy as the cgroup hierarchy if sane_behavior is enabled.
As this concludes proper hierarchy support for blkcg, the shameful
.broken_hierarchy tag is removed from blkio_subsys.

v2: Updated blkio-controller.txt as suggested by Vivek.

Many of the errors were about constant-named fields that aren't actually constant.  I opted to just suppress these warnings, rather than rename them, since they do behave like constants, and they should be consistent across different files.

It might be nice to fix these someday down the road, though it's not clear what the best approach would be.  Simply adding ""commonTypes."" isn't too terrible, particularly for any that are only used once or twice; for more frequently-used types, a getter and/or query method might be more appropriate.

Alternatively, if we could (a) eliminate the `inCompatibilityMode` flag to JSTypes, and (b) make the rest of the fields constant, it would be possible to make these types actually static constants.  The second part might be difficult, since the properties of many of these types *do* depend on externs, which may change from compilation to compilation.  These would take a lot more work to factor out: we'd need to figure out how to remove the reference to JSTypes in the really-constant versions, or else have an extra instance of it with only a subset of types (provided this doesn't cause any problems).

Whitehall publisher embeds the path to assets inside content items, an
example of this is in: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/windrush-lessons-learned-review-information
where there is HTML of:

```
  <div class=""attachment-thumb"">
      <a aria-hidden=""true"" class=""thumbnail"" tabindex=""-1"" href=""/government/publications/windrush-lessons-learned-review-information/windrush-lessons-learned-review-independent-advisory-group-membership-list-and-biographies""><img alt="""" src=""/government/assets/pub-cover-html-b0465911e56983d98c70f0e25fba24bc206d37e8c83d4addf6421dcf6022c6cd.png""></a>
  </div>
```

When changing the asset host from assets.publishing.service.gov.uk to
www.gov.uk I expected to find assets that were hosted on
https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/assets/* as per
other Whitehall assets, finding some on www.gov.uk/government/assets was
it self as a surprise. These assets shouldn't actually have been
working, I'll explain why at the end of this commit.

Since there are a lot of assets embedded with /government/assets I
thought it'd be more prudent to set an nginx internal rewrite than an
actual redirect to avoid creating a huge mass of redirects.

I've said this many times in many places now, but the whole thing of
Whitehall embedding assets into content items is an awful situation that
leaves a trail of smells like this change here.

Anyway... how did the www.gov.uk/government/assets even work?

These assets shouldn't have worked as there isn't a proxy pass set up
for requests to www.gov.uk/government/assets to Whitehall, so they
shouldn't have been served. However we have a curious part of GOV.UK
that is a source of confusion: the /government prefix route [1].

Because of this route these assets were still served. They worked by
router accepting the request for an asset path and then proxying that to
Whitehall.

oh, and adjust its size.

While I am here, I am gonna rant.
I realize that absolutely nobody is reading this and even if someone is, they would have no clue what I am ranting about.

well, I don't care.

The original designs of this goddamn game is so fucking obnoxious.
The UI looks nice. The frames are good looking. The actions are not too smooth but acceptable. HTML and CSS allows much better control and much more design elements than C++. Not needing to write a fucking QT translation patch is absolutely beautiful.
However, that's about where the praise ends. The system design is fine, but just, so fucking much of the UI design decisions is horrible.
Hey, we have card text. We are going to fit the card text into the world's smallest readable fucking box so that no matter how short a text is, it would always look like a goddamn spagetti. seriously, the box can hold like 8 words on one line. EIGHT. a single sentence is like 15 to 30 words, and that's just the short ones. once we get to 150...oh boy. That's not even a long paragraph! But its going to be 20 lines of text and look like a goddamn wall and you are gonna like it.
Oh and it scrolls at the like 7 lines so have fun with that. Not to mention the ridicious placement of the skill name itself.
Hey, here's a grid, which have 12 columns. We are going to fit words into them. 12 words a row is not actually that bad, if you don't take 4 columns out and just leave them empty for no goddamn reason!
I swear to god, if people realize how easy it is to change CSS files, nobody will be putting up with this shit.

the problem with text doesn't even end there. The game is actually rather helpful. There are tooltips in the settings that you can read. It would be a nice addition, if you didn't have to click four times into THE MOST HIDDEN-AWAY MENU IN THE ENTIRE GAME to get even read them!
They are literally in the last menu of the last menu, and is the only place in the game that has 3 layers of menu.
Oh and there's absolutely nothing indicating the help docs even exists, and the help docs shares the textbox with the other one I just ranted at.
The developer tunnels on developped vision so hard it's actually kind of fasinacting at this point.
It took me a year to even notice there was even a help doc in the game. and I develop this game every week. I only found about this thing because I was going through every string in a script for some reason and just came across it.
The tunnel vision only gets more insane too. There are 3 extra game modes the developper has designed and developed himself, into the game, along with several expansion packs. Which is fairly neat. They are somewhat interesting, usually not too overpowered, and is generally a fresh breath of life into the game.
But that is also a hugeass problem.
Because, as the gamer, I should not be forced to download 200 to 300 extra sets of assets to even run the game.
If you clearly know that what you made is not what the consumer is coming for, you can still roll the expansion in, but fuck it should not take double the amount of space and assets the original base game takes.
Its like, when somebody buys Catan, you package in 4 expansions, charge them extra (in terms of space consumption), and just sells it to them without even telling them what is in it.
And as the cherry on top, also package all the instruction manuals into the smallest baggie attached to the bottom of one of the resources cards in one of the expansions and pretend you didn't know it existed.
Needless to say, these things might as well as not exist to the general player.
But the consequence doesn't even end at the goddamn space consumption.

There is so much goddamn garbage code and useless settings in the game engine that I am actually kind of amazed.

Yes, this framework is rather powerful tool, but goddamn if it is not butchered by developer tunnel vision and simply stupid design.

Out of the 230 commits I have made, I think like a third of it is adding quality of life and UI changes. I can't even go back to the basegame now cuz its just so unbearable.

well, rant over.

When awesome restarts because a new screen was added or removed, clients can end
up being on a different screen than before the restart. However, the tags will
be carried across the restart. This means that a client could end up being
tagged with a tag from another screen. This results in weird behavior of tag
switches and confuses users.

To work around this, remove the client from any tags that are on a different
screen during startup. If the client ends up without any tags, it will then be
tagged with the currently selected tags.

  - Show user in public repository URL (probably mostly obsolete with hosting?)

We can add those back if users notice, but they seem like the three least useful options so I'm going to see if we can get away with removing them.

Test Plan: Clicked ""Edit"" from Repositories, got kicked into the nice new Diffusion edit UI instead of the old one.

This adds functions for getting directories according to the XDG base dir
specification. This might be useful in general.

This also adds a function for getting the cache dir, because I like an explicit
function call more than something which ""switches"" based on a string argument.
Better error messages if you mis-type something. :-)

Finally, this adds a function for getting the directory containing the rc.lua
file. Sadly, awful.util.getdir(""config"") did not actually do that. See #218.

  Replaced with instruction sequences that do the equivalent truncation in
  SPUInstrInfo.td.

- Re-examine how unaligned loads and stores work. Generated unaligned
  load code has been tested on the CellSPU hardware; see the i32operations.c
  and i64operations.c in CodeGen/CellSPU/useful-harnesses.  (While they may be
  toy test code, it does prove that some real world code does compile
  correctly.)

- Fix truncating stores in bug 3193 (note: unpack_df.ll will still make llc
  fault because i64 ult is not yet implemented.)

- Added i64 eq and neq for setcc and select/setcc; started new instruction
  information file for them in SPU64InstrInfo.td. Additional i64 operations
  should be added to this file and not to SPUInstrInfo.td.

Currently, there are substantial problems forming vld1_dup even if the
VDUP survives legalization. The lack of an actual node
leads to terrible results: not only can we not form post-increment vld1_dup
instructions, but we form scalar pre-increment and post-increment
loads which force the loaded value into a GPR. This patch fixes that
by combining the vdup+load into an ARMISD node before DAGCombine
messes it up.

Also includes a crash fix for vld2_dup (see testcase @vld2dupi8_postinc_variable).

Pull vfs update from Al Viro:

 - big one - consolidation of descriptor-related logics; almost all of
   that is moved to fs/file.c

   (BTW, I'm seriously tempted to rename the result to fd.c.  As it is,
   we have a situation when file_table.c is about handling of struct
   file and file.c is about handling of descriptor tables; the reasons
   are historical - file_table.c used to be about a static array of
   struct file we used to have way back).

   A lot of stray ends got cleaned up and converted to saner primitives,
   disgusting mess in android/binder.c is still disgusting, but at least
   doesn't poke so much in descriptor table guts anymore.  A bunch of
   relatively minor races got fixed in process, plus an ext4 struct file
   leak.

 - related thing - fget_light() partially unuglified; see fdget() in
   there (and yes, it generates the code as good as we used to have).

 - also related - bits of Cyrill's procfs stuff that got entangled into
   that work; _not_ all of it, just the initial move to fs/proc/fd.c and
   switch of fdinfo to seq_file.

 - Alex's fs/coredump.c spiltoff - the same story, had been easier to
   take that commit than mess with conflicts.  The rest is a separate
   pile, this was just a mechanical code movement.

 - a few misc patches all over the place.  Not all for this cycle,
   there'll be more (and quite a few currently sit in akpm's tree).""

Fix up trivial conflicts in the android binder driver, and some fairly
simple conflicts due to two different changes to the sock_alloc_file()
interface (""take descriptor handling from sock_alloc_file() to callers""
vs ""net: Providing protocol type via system.sockprotoname xattr of
/proc/PID/fd entries"" adding a dentry name to the socket)

widespread glibc bugs.

The glibc implementation of exp10 has a very serious precision bug in
version 2.15 (and older versions). This is still very widely used (the
current Ubuntu LTS for example uses it) and so it isn't reasonable to
make transforms that produce these functions. This fixes many
miscompiles introduced when we started transforming pow(10.0, ...) into
exp10, and it may have fixed other latent miscompiles where exp10
provided sufficient precision but exp10f did not.

This is all really horrible. The primary bug has been fixed for over
a year and glibc 2.18 works correctly for the test cases I have, but it
will be 2017 before the LTS using 2.15 is no longer supported by Ubuntu
(and thus reasonable for folks to be relying on). =[ We're either going
to need to live without these optimizations, or find a way to switch
behavior more dynamically than using simply the fact that the OS is
""Linux"".

To make matters worse, there appears to be significant testing and
fixing of numerous other bugs in the exp10 family of functions right now
in glibc. While those haven't been causing problems I've seen in the
wild, it gives me concerns that we may need to wait until an even later

0a50019fde7781263e0c8f041d1d9dcb0dee77e8 Walk pindexBestHeader back to ChainActive().Tip() if it is invalid (Matt Corallo)

Pull request description:

  Instead of keeping pindexBestHeader set to the best header we've
  ever seen, reset it back to our validated tip if we find an ancestor
  of it turns out to be invalid. While the name is now a bit confusing,
  this matches much better with how it is used in practice, see below.
  Further, this opens up more use-cases for it in the future, namely
  aggressively searching for new peers in case we have discovered
  (possibly via some covert channel) headers which we do not know to be
  invalid, but which we cannot find block data for.

  Places pindexBestHeader is used:

   * Various GUI displays of the best header and getblockchaininfo[""headers""],
     I don't think changing this is bad, and if anything this is less confusing
     in the presence of an invalid block.
   * IsCurrentForFeeEstimation(): If anything I think ensuring pindexBestHeader
     isn't some crazy invalid chain is better than the alternative, even in the
     case where you are rejecting the current chain due to hardware error (since
     hopefully in that case you won't get any new blocks anyway).
   * ConnectBlock assumevalid checks: We use pindexBestHeader to check that the
     block we're connecting leads to something with nMinimumChainWork (preventing
     a user-set assumevalid from having bogus work) and that the block we're
     connecting leads to pindexBestHeader (I'm not too worried about this one -
     it's nice to ""disable"" assumevalid if we have a long invalid headers chain,
     but I don't see it as a critical protection).
   * BlockRequestAllowed() uses pindexBestHeader as its target to ensure the
     requested block is within a month of the ""current chain"". I don't think this
     is a meaningful difference, if we're rejecting the current tip we're
     trivially fingerprintable anyway, and if the chain really does have a bunch
     of invalid crap near the tip, using the best not-invalid header is likely a
     better criteria.
   * ProcessGetBlockData uses pindexBestHeader as the ""current chain"" definition
     of whether a block request is ""historical"" for the purpose of bandwidth
     limiting. Similarly, I don't see why this is a meaningful change.
   * We use pindexBestHeader for requesting missing headers on receipt of a
     headers/compact block message or block inv as well as for initial getheaders.
     I think this is definitely wrong, using the best not-invalid header for such
     requests is much better.
   * We use pindexBestHeader to define the ""current chain"" for deciding when
     we're close to done with initial headers sync. I don't think this is a
     meaningful change.
   * We use pindexBestHeader to decide if initial headers sync has timed out. If
     we're rejecting the chain due to hardware error this may result in
     additional cases where we ban a peer, but this is already true, so I think
     its fine.

In theory this will have performance and power improvements. Performance
because we don't need to stall when the scanout BO is busy, and power
because we don't have to stall when the BO is busy (and the ring can
even go to sleep if the HW supports it).

v2:
squash 2 patches into 1 (me)
un-inline the enable_semaphores function (Daniel)
remove comment about SNB hangs from i915_gem_object_sync (Chris)
rename intel_enable_semaphores to i915_semaphore_is_enabled (me)
removed page flip comment; ""no why"" (Chris)

To address other comments from Daniel (irc):
update the comment to say 'vt-d is crap, don't enable semaphores'
  - I think you misinterpreted Chris' comment, it already exists.
checking out whether we can pageflip on the render ring on ivb (didn't
work on early silicon)
  - We don't want to enable workarounds for early silicon unless we have
    to.
  - I can't find any references in the docs about this.
optionally use it if the fb is already busy on the render ring
  - This should be how the code already worked, unless I am
    misunderstanding your meaning.

creates a hole and we actually have a bunch that *does* forget.

So let's keep our lives simple - let __fput() check FASYNC in

When there was nothing to display in the review request actions bar,
it'd appear as a thin line, which looked horrible. This was because
there wasn't any content on the bar to force the height to anything
reasonable.

We already have a :before style, with no padding or content. This change
updates it to have some content (which is hidden but still takes up
room), and the same padding that the actions themselves have.

Also, I previously swapped the names of two variables (the ones use for
vert and horiz padding on actions). The vert was containing the horiz
padding, and vice-versa. These have been fixed up.

Testing Done:
Viewed an interdiff, which has no actions. Saw that the bar was the correct height.

    Tests require the bitstring package.

    How these work:
    fakeoftable is an implementation of the adding and removal of
    entries into an openflow flow table. It allows for addition
    and removal of flows using flow modification messages. You can
    probe the table to determine what flow table entries a packet
    with provided fields will match. It also has a method for
    verifying if a packet will be output to a specified port with
    a specified vlan.

    This is an imitation of OVS's ofproto/trace command. I built
    this from scratch rather than using OVS because using OVS was
    going to require a significant amount of parsing anyway, and
    would require root access to set up the test network. One of
    the requirements here was to be able to be run in a continuous
    integration model and requiring root just seemed like a
    terrible idea. I looked for another implementation of a 0f1.3
    flow table that would do this, but I couldnt find one. In the
    end this implementation (which is not complete, eg it will
    need group support to be added if we ever use that) took less
    than 400 lines, which seems supportable. I have tried to make
    it as easy to follow as possible. I will probably add some
    additional comments in a future commit.

    The unit tests then are very simple. They instantiate a valve,
    and apply the flow mods resulting from its functions to a
    fakeoftable instance, then test whether example packets are
    being handled correctly.

    At the moment the tests only cover basic L2 + vlans
    functionality.

    Fix engineIFPLoad failure on resource multiple restarts

    IFP was failing to load after restarting resource multiple times, because it was removed from map in CElementDeleter::DeleteIFP which caused a small delay in ms. Now, it will be removed from map when it's added to element deleter list, so engineLoadIFP won't fail because the element with the same block name does not exist in map anymore.

    [FIX] Unloading IFP will allow gateway animation to play instead of custom
    Custom animation was not playing if you unloaded IFP. I used a shared_ptr to fix this problem. Also, unloading IFP resulted in looped animations to play gateway animation instead of custom, so fixed that as well.

    optimized CopyAnimation hook for saving tons of RAM
    If we created a new static association for every player for every single animation then it means for 1000 players, the memory might exceed 400mb, that's a lot. Why not destroy the static association when we copy the animation from it? That's exactly what's happening in the hook now.

    Modified AddAnimation, AddAnimationAndSync, and CopyAnimation for replacing GTA internal animations with custom animations. We'll need to create our own static association when engineReplaceAnimation is called and use that static association for a specific ped/player to play our custom animation instead.

    Rewrote animation hooks properly in CClientGame and CMultiplayerSA
    I renamed BlendAnimation hook to BlendAnimationHierarchy because now it's hooking a different BlendAnimation function that takes an animation hierarchy as argument. Also, I separated AddAnimation and AddAnimationAndSync hooks and their handlers. Now, they work independently. Also, there was a problem with AddAnimationAndSync hook in CMultiplayerSA.cpp, I fixed the return of the hook.

    I used Original code for AddAnimation hook in CClientGame::AddAnimationHandler. It works well. Now, it's time to create our own CAnimBlendAssociationSAInterface instead of using CopyAnimation. I'll need to enable AddAnimationAndSync hook as well because this is called for almost every internal GTA animation.

Summary:
Previously, when the watchman subscription pipe had nothing in it,
we would create an artificial JSON object and process that. What an odd
and terrible hack. It also made debugging our Watchman client more
difficult (and my ""debugging"" I mean putting print statements
everywhere).

This uses an option instead.

The per-zone waitqueues exist because of a scalability issue with the
page waitqueues on some NUMA machines, but it turns out that they hurt
normal loads, and now with the vmalloced stacks they also end up
breaking gfs2 that uses a bit_wait on a stack object:

     wait_on_bit(&gh->gh_iflags, HIF_WAIT, TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE)

where 'gh' can be a reference to the local variable 'mount_gh' on the
stack of fill_super().

The reason the per-zone hash table breaks for this case is that there is
no ""zone"" for virtual allocations, and trying to look up the physical
page to get at it will fail (with a BUG_ON()).

It turns out that I actually complained to the mm people about the
per-zone hash table for another reason just a month ago: the zone lookup
also hurts the regular use of ""unlock_page()"" a lot, because the zone
lookup ends up forcing several unnecessary cache misses and generates
horrible code.

As part of that earlier discussion, we had a much better solution for
the NUMA scalability issue - by just making the page lock have a
separate contention bit, the waitqueue doesn't even have to be looked at
for the normal case.

Peter Zijlstra already has a patch for that, but let's see if anybody
even notices.  In the meantime, let's fix the actual gfs2 breakage by
simplifying the bitlock waitqueues and removing the per-zone issue.

Fix AZ related API docs

While we have a big fat comment in the development docs explaining why it's so
terrible to use default AZ values for either booting an instance or setting
an aggregate AZ metadata, we still have confusing API docs that provide the
wrong name for the AZ...

Fixing that and trying to explain the problem within the docs, too.

Load times on list view pages like Slices, Dashboards, Tables and Database
have grown to be terrible over time.

After a bit of digging, I found that the not specifying `search_columns`
in ModelViews actually means ""all columns"" and that for each filter,
FAB goes and fetches a list of all values to prepopulate the
filter dropdowns. That means that the list of tables would fetch all
slices and all users upfront which is horrible. Worse, database list
view would fetch all queries with is insane.

The tests haven't worked on Windows since PR #5352 landed and making
them work there now has proved to be quite difficult, either involving
the use of some terrible, unmaintable batch scripting or some major
changes to the tests. Given that the tests only exercise the openssh
based connections (as opposed to gocrypto) and that it's unlikely that
openssh client software will actually be available on a windows client
machine, we don't lose much by not running these test on Windows.

Such checks and the like have been moved to that. If any of these procs return -1, the operation is canceled.

I also fixed some of the recipes that didn't work. The reagent IDs for them didn't exist, leading me to believe that they weren't tested. I corrected that! (I've tested every single recipe in this PR, with the exception of a few juicing-related ones.)

This is mostly a mechanical change changing all the call sites to the newer
chained-function construction pattern.  This removes the horrible 15-parameter
constructor for the CallLoweringInfo in favour of setting properties of the call
via chained functions.  No functional change beyond the removal of the old
constructors are intended.

SVR4 probably has the same problem, but I don't know how to fix it;
there is no red zone and R2 is already used for something else.
I'm going to leave it to someone interested in that target.

Better still would be to rewrite the CR-saving code completely;
spilling each CR subregister individually is horrible code.

Discussion
----------

[HttpKernel][MonologBridge] PSR-3 support

This enables PSR-3 support and monolog 1.3+. The first commit is the main part. The rest deals with deprecation of short-hand methods (warn/err/crit/emerg) that are fully expanded in PSR-3 (warning/error/critical/emergency).

The downside of deprecating them is that for bundles it's a bit harder to support older and newer versions. If that is too much of a hassle you can drop that for now and cherry pick the first commit.

The upside is that it forces people to move towards PSR-3 compatible stuff, which means eventually we could completely drop the LoggerInterface from the framework. In any case I think the documentation should only mention the `Psr\Log\LoggerInterface` and people should start hinting against that. The change should be done in core as well I suppose.

Anyway I wanted to throw this out there as it is to get feedback.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2013-01-09T09:15:15Z

@Seldaek I also think you should change the typehint to use the PSR LoggerInterface in all classes using the logger

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Seldaek at 2013-01-09T09:54:55Z

OK updated according to all the feedback. I tested it in an app and it still seems to work so there shouldn't be any major issues.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Seldaek at 2013-01-09T09:59:55Z

@fabpot if you merge please merge also the bundle PR, otherwise it won't be possible to update without conflict.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by frosas at 2013-01-10T14:59:20Z

I'm trying to understand why a `composer update` of a Symfony 2.1.* resulted in a fatal error. Shouldn't a stable version don't break like this?

As @olaurendeau points, why Symfony depends 1.* instead of 1.2.*? Or why Monolog 1.3 breaks its public interface (EDIT: I'm not sure about it)? Or why isn't this PR being merged (into branch 2.1) at the same time Monolog 1.3 is released?

Please, understand I'm not looking for who to blame, it's just I want to know if this situation is unexpected or if otherwise a `composer update` on a stable branch is not as innocent as it seems.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2013-01-10T15:06:51Z

@frosas it cannot be merged into 2.1 as it is a BC break. The 2.1 branch has been updated to forbid Monolog 1.3 already

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Seldaek at 2013-01-10T15:11:58Z

@frosas you can blame me for releasing as 1.3.0 and not 2.0, but technically for monolog this isn't really a BC break, I just added an interface. The problem is due to the way it's used in symfony, it ended up as a fatal error. In any case the situation is now sorted out I think.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by frosas at 2013-01-10T15:26:43Z

@stof now I see this `>=1.0,<1.3-dev` change in the 2.1 branch. Now, shouldn't a new (2.1.7) version be released for all of us not in the dev minimum-stability?

@Seldaek then do you see feasible to rely only in X.Y.* versions to avoid this kind of errors?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Seldaek at 2013-01-10T15:45:22Z

@frosas relying on X.Y.* is painful because you always need to wait until someone updates the constraint to get the new version. Of course using ~1.3 like in this PR means if I fuck up and break BC people will update to it, but that's a less likely occurrence than the alternative I think, so I would rather not use X.Y.*

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by frosas at 2013-01-10T15:50:50Z

@Seldaek you are right about this, but I was thinking more in changing it only for the stable versions. EDIT: I mean, how often do you need a new feature in a branch you only apply fixes to?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2013-01-10T15:57:32Z

@frosas Monolog and Symfony have separate release cycles. Foorcing Symfony users to use an old version of Monolog until they update to a new version of Symfony whereas the newer Monolog is compatible is a bad idea. Thus, as Monolog keeps BC, it does not maintain bugfix releases for all older versions (just like Twig does too). So it would also forbid you to get the fixes done in newer Monolog versions.

The incompatibility between Symfony 2.1 LoggerInterface and PSR-3 (whereas they expect exactly the same behavior and signature for methods with the same name) is unfortunate and is the reason why we get some issues here.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by frosas at 2013-01-10T16:21:06Z

@stof I appreciate you prefer to allow newer versions at the price of having to be constantly monitoring its changes to avoid breaks.

Another similar but safer strategy would be to stick to X.Y.* versions and upgrade to X.Y+1.* once the new version integration is tested, but I understand this is discutible in projects as close to Symfony as Monolog.

Returning to the issue, what do you say to release this 2.1.7 version? Or is it only me who is having issues here?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2013-01-10T16:26:20Z

@frosas a minor release should not break BC when following smeantic versionning (Symfony warned about the fact it is not strictly followed for the first releases of 2.x). But as far as monolog is concerned, 1.3 is BC with 1.2.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Seldaek at 2013-01-10T16:49:55Z

@frosas sorry I didn't get you still had the problem. I tagged a 2.1.7 of monologbundle which hopefully fixes your issue.

This is the Ralink RT3070 driver from the company that does horrible
things like reading a config file from /etc.  However, the driver that
is currently under development from the wireless development community
is not working at all yet, so distros and users are using this version
instead (quite common hardware on a lot of netbook machines).

So here is this driver, for now, until the wireless developers get a
""clean"" version into the main tree, or until this version is cleaned up
sufficiently to move out of the staging tree.

Ported to the Linux build system, fixed lots of build issues, forward
ported to the current kernel version, and other minor cleanups were all
done by me.

It makes the code really ugly. And since it can be enabled only before
building and only in the source files, it can be barely used by users.
That said, I've not seen anybody to use it in the past few years.

not their maintainer, I'm not sure if I should remove them too?

We can convert any select-of-constants to math ops:
http://rise4fun.com/Alive/d7d

For this patch, I'm enhancing an existing x86 transform that uses fake multiplies 
(they always become shl/lea) to avoid cmov or branching. The current code misses 
cases where we have a negative constant and a positive constant, so this is just 
trying to plug that hole.

The DAGCombiner diff prevents us from hitting a terrible inefficiency: we can start 
with a select in IR, create a select DAG node, convert it into a sext, convert it 
back into a select, and then lower it to sext machine code.

Some notes about the test diffs:

1. 2010-08-04-MaskedSignedCompare.ll - We were creating control flow that didn't exist in the IR.
2. memcmp.ll - Choose -1 or 1 is the case that got me looking at this again. I 
   think we could avoid the push/pop in some cases if we used 'movzbl %al' instead of an xor on 
   a different reg? That's a post-DAG problem though.
3. mul-constant-result.ll - The trade-off between sbb+not vs. setne+neg could be addressed if 
   that's a regression, but I think those would always be nearly equivalent.
4. pr22338.ll and sext-i1.ll - These tests have undef operands, so I don't think we actually care about these diffs.
5. sbb.ll - This shows a win for what I think is a common case: choose -1 or 0.
6. select.ll - There's another borderline case here: cmp+sbb+or vs. test+set+lea? Also, sbb+not vs. setae+neg shows up again.
7. select_const.ll - These are motivating cases for the enhancement; replace cmov with cheaper ops.

Assembly differences between movzbl and xor to avoid a partial reg stall are caused later by the X86 Fixup SetCC pass.

Problems this is trying to solve:

JS models tend to make API calls for CRUD (and other) operations. Validating on the client side is
sometimes insufficient for detecting errors, and inevitably, the user will encounter errors that might
only be validated server-side and which prevent a user-initiated action from succeeding.

1) In such cases, the errors embedded in the server response should bind back to the respective fields
   in the model so that the user can correct the errors and resubmit the API request until success.

2) There may also be errors on fields not accounted/implemented by a JS model which prevent the API
   submission from succeeding. As there are no such fields in the model, errors would otherwise not be
   visible to the user, thus giving the impression that the page is broken and, honestly, a horrible
   user experience.

This implementation of `consumeErrorsResponse()` addresses both of these concerns by a) binding errors
in the server response back to the models and b) returning a set of errors that could not be matched
to a field in any model or sub-model in the hierarchy. Implementors are responsible for presenting any
unbound errors to the user.

Implementation notes:

Complete reimplementation of `consumeErrorsResponse()` inverts the data direction:

  - Instead of traversing the models and looking for errors on known fields in the server response,
    traverse the server response and record errors on model fields while keeping track of errors on
    unknown fields. Tracking unknown field errors was not possible in the previous implementation.
  - Encapsulates this related behavior into a class/mixin (and interface) `ErrorsConsumer`.
  - The class/mixin `ValidatableMixin` now extends `ErrorsConsumer`, so all `ValidatableMixin`
    subclasses also satisfy the `ErrorsConsumer` contract and thus get `consumeErrorsResponse()`
    for free.
  - Moves the `errors()` member from `ValidatableMixin` to `ErrorsConsumer`.
  - Sometimes the model hierarchy on the client-side does not exactly match the hierarchy on the
    server-side (and thus the server response object). Subclasses can override the `errorContainerFor()`
    function on an `ErrorsConsumer` to assign the appropriate descendant to which to bind the field
    error.

commit 5dc3826d9f08 (""efi: Implement mandatory locking for UEFI Runtime
Services"") implemented some conditional locking when accessing variable
runtime services that Ingo described as ""pretty disgusting"".

The intention with the !efi_in_nmi() checks was to avoid live-locks when
trying to write pstore crash data into an EFI variable. Such lockless
accesses are allowed according to the UEFI specification when we're in a
""non-recoverable"" state, but whether or not things are implemented
correctly in actual firmware implementations remains an unanswered
question, and so it would seem sensible to avoid doing any kind of
unsynchronized variable accesses.

Furthermore, the efi_in_nmi() tests are inadequate because they don't
account for the case where we call EFI variable services from panic or
oops callbacks and aren't executing in NMI context. In other words,
live-locking is still possible.

Let's just remove the conditional locking altogether. Now we've got the
->set_variable_nonblocking() EFI variable operation we can abort if the
runtime lock is already held. Aborting is by far the safest option.

The use of execve() in the kernel is dubious, since it relies on the
__KERNEL_SYSCALLS__ mechanism that stores the result in a global errno
variable.  As a first step of getting rid of this, change all users to a
global kernel_execve function that returns a proper error code.

This function is a terrible hack, and a later patch removes it again after the
kernel syscalls are gone.

To remove the neede for msi_lookup_irq I added first_msi_irq to struct
pci_dev.  Then depending on the context I replaced msi_lookup_irq with
dev->first_msi_irq, dev->msi_enabled, or dev->msix_enabled.

msi_enabled and msix_enabled were already present in pci_dev for other
reasons.

Fixed lp:1492066: cloud-init userdata for centos7 assumes firewalld exists

The cloud-init userdata generation code for CentOS is assuming firewalld
is installed and active when it tries to stop it with:

```
systemctl stop firewalld
systemctl disable firewalld
```

However, on CentOS 7.1 it seems firewalld is not always configured as a
service, hence the first line fails and aborts cloud-init.

Before trying to stop firewalld now we check if it's enabled first.
`is-enabled` fails if firewalld is not even loaded as a service, or it can
return the status (e.g. ""enabled"", ""active"", ""dead""). We ignore the
error (if any) from `is-enabled` and then use `systemctl mask firewalld`
to make sure the service cannot be started again, and finally we stop it.

While trying to test the change, I realized it's about time to refactor
cloudconfig/userdatacfg_test.go first, as it's full of duplicated code
and it's very difficult to follow. In fact apart from a few tests for
Windows, it turned out we're NOT testing non-Ubuntu UNIX userdata
generation AT ALL! This is now fixed, and hopefully makes those awful
tests slightly easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

See http://pad.lv/1492066.

Tested manually on CentOS 7.1 with vagrant.

This script is currently specific to x86 and limited to use with very
small regression or feature tests using 'llc' and 'FileCheck' in
a reasonably canonical way. It is in no way general purpose or robust at
this point. However, it works quite well for simple examples. Here is
the intended workflow:

- Make a change that requires updating N test files and M functions'
  assertions within those files.
- Stash the change.
- Update those N test files' RUN-lines to look ""canonical""[1].
- Refresh the FileCheck lines for either the entire file or select
  functions by running this script.
  - The script will parse the RUN lines and run the 'llc' binary you
    give it according to each line, collecting the asm.
  - It will then annotate each function with the appropriate FileCheck
    comments to check every instruction from the start of the first
    basic block to the last return.
  - There will be numerous cases where the script either fails to remove
    the old lines, or inserts checks which need to be manually editted,
    but the manual edits tend to be deletions or replacements of
    registers with FileCheck variables which are fast manual edits.
  - A common pattern is to have the script insert complete checking of
    every instruction, and then edit it down to only check the relevant
    ones.
  - Be careful to do all of these cleanups though! The script is
    designed to make transferring and formatting the asm output of llc
    into a test case fast, it is *not* designed to be authoratitive
    about what constitutes a good test!
- Commit the nice fresh baseline of checks.
- Unstash your change and rebuild llc.
- Re-run script to regenerate the FileCheck annotations
  - Remember to re-cleanup these annotations!!!
- Check the diff to make sure this is sane, checking the things you
  expected it to, and check that the newly updated tests actually pass.
- Profit!

Also, I'm *terrible* at writing Python, and frankly I didn't spend a lot
of time making this script beautiful or well engineered. But it's useful
to me and may be useful to others so I thought I'd send it out.

Like, it's literally useless with our synthflesh+silver sulf... meta

Not anymore.

Today, I'm dramatically improving the healing and giving a decent time reduction to doing this surgery.

Having a regular object that 'is' a number was causing horrible problems for type inference and generated code quality.

To get this to work required fixes in type inference and the collection of reified default argument values.

Which effectively saves us… a grand total of 1 binary hack per
game, because it only works as intended with the ruby font. Dialogue is
unfortunately printed with the same font as spell cards, endings, and
the Music Room, which we *don't* want to reduce the quality of. So not
only would this need one binary hack for changing the in-game dialogue
font, we'd also need *another* one to differentiate the new dialogue
font, so that thcrap can apply the rules… which are then pointless
because you might as well just include them.

And in the end, the text still looks like shit.

Oh well, ruby legibility *is* kinda important, so let's still go with
this.

(Or maybe we can inject a new font switch command into each dialogue MSG
file. Then we'd save that one hack. Whatever, just wait until I actually
get to that feature, will you? Thanks.)

That's the data structure chip functions get provided. Also allow them
to signal the core code that they updated the flags in irq_data.state
by returning IRQ_SET_MASK_OK_NOCOPY. The default is unchanged.

The type bits should be accessed via:

val = irqd_get_trigger_type(irqdata);
and
irqd_set_trigger_type(irqdata, val);

Coders who access them directly will be tracked down and slapped with
stinking trouts.

The merge is only possible if the base address register is the
same for the two instructions. If there is only the one use,
there's no point in doing an expensive forward scan checking
for memory interference looking for a merge candidate.

This gives a signficant improvement in one extreme testcase.
The code to do the scan is still algorithmically terrible,
so this is still the slowest pass in that example.

Currently std::mutex has a constexpr constructor, but a non-trivial
destruction.

The constexpr constructor is required to ensure the construction of a
mutex with static storage duration happens at compile time, during
constant initialization, and not during dynamic initialization.
This means that static mutex's are always initialized and can be used
safely during dynamic initialization without the ""static initialization
order fiasco"".

A trivial destructor is important for similar reasons. If a mutex is
used during dynamic initialization it might also be used during program
termination. If a static mutex has a non-trivial destructor it will be
invoked during termination. This can introduce the ""static
deinitialization order fiasco"".

Additionally, function-local statics emit a guard variable around
non-trivially destructible types. This results in horrible codegen and
adds a runtime cost to every call to that function. non-local static's
also result in slightly worse codegen but it's not as big of a problem.

Example codegen can be found here: https://goo.gl/3CSzbM

Note: This optimization is not safe with every pthread implementation.
Some implementations allocate on the first call to pthread_mutex_lock
and free the allocation in pthread_mutex_destroy.

Also, changing the triviality of the destructor is not an ABI break.
At least to the best of my knowledge :-)

Summary:
Without this patch, the memory manager would call `mprotect` on every memory
region it ever allocated whenever it wanted to finalize memory (i.e. not just
the ones it just allocated). This caused terrible performance problems for
long running memory managers. In one particular compile heavy julia benchmark,
we were spending 50% of time in `mprotect` if running under MCJIT.

Fix this by splitting allocated memory blocks into those on which memory
permissions have been set and those on which they haven't and only running
`mprotect` on the latter.

Summary:Hard to make a diff more disgusting than this but it has merits in its disgrace.
This is giving us an easy way out of optimizations for certain optimizations.
Essentially introduces a concept of do not optimize at all that when applied to a class translates to all memebers of the class.
All of that for certain optimizations only! The one that care to look for it basically.
For now those are the one we know can be problematic like inline and static relo.
It also makes the inliner support random annotation to stop inlining if desired.
The PgoFile class is also taking a clownish shape being much more that the PGO stuff it was originally intended for.
We need to clean all of this up really soon, but this is it for now.
This picks (and so does not optimize) few methods in static relo and few in the inliner. Those seem to be around classes that were delicate (i.e. Lcom/facebook/acra/ErrorReporter$Api9Utils;) so it seems good

This commit add an optional `--screen off` command to initialize Lua
without first adding the screens. This is inconvinient for most users
since it restrict the APIs that are usable out of the box.

However, this allows AwesomeWM to work independently from the hardware.
This means that when a screen is unplugged, it is the Lua code that will
remove the screen instead of CAPI pulling the carpet from under. It also
allows to ignore some screen areas before the screen is ever created.
Combined, it makes it possible to work with screens even when they are
physically disconnected. Finally, it will allow for an awful.rules like
API to control how screens are created.

All in all, some people need this for their setup and some people might
want to do it anyway for fine grained and/or dynamaic multi-screen
setups.

This commit also adds 4 new signals to `capi` to be able to
execute code at specific points during the initialization. The commit
improves naughty error notifications to work even if problems occurs
before the screens are added.

Note that AwesomeWM will exit if no screens are created. While it would
be easy to just call `refresh_screen();` after unsetting the magic
variable, doing so would have corner cases. Better be harsher and
prevent the user from shooting themselves in the foot from not reading
the f****** manual. Code introduced in future commits will take care
of automatically calling fake_screen in the event nothing is created.

balance: plasma cutter blasts no longer have a pressure penalty, but do 1/4 their old damage
/:cl:

Call this an ""i ded pls nerf"" situation but god damn the only things i've felt more bullshitted by than plasma cutters are the fuckin RNG getting a grenade exploded out of my hand and playing vs unsynced borgs as a rogue AI. Nothing else feels quite as unfair as getting demolished by 15 people all holding 2 advanced plasma cutters, meanwhile the god damn stations actual armory of lethal gear is collecting dust because they're entirely outclassed by cutters against quite a few common threats.

That said, this PR isn't the best change, but neither was tlal's or the other guys. In my opinion, the simplest change that would keep their original purpose(godlike mining tools) while toning down their combat ability would be to just keep their damage really low in general and keep them exclusively made for their mining abilities.

reason kinetic accelerator is fine and not in jeopardy of nerf PR: mostly limited, theres reasonable ways to print more but you cant get them by the hundreds with. 40 brute damage/1.6s with no pressure penalty, 70 brute damage/1.6s generally. Can't be dual wielded effectively.

reason adv cutters are retarded: first mining load can generally print 50-60 adv cutters, more if RND bothered to upgrade anything(most miners end up upgrading their own shit if science doesnt). 28 brute/1s generally, 56/s when dual wielded.

in 3 seconds, an adv cutter can do 168 damage, KA can do 140 at best. Combine this with the fact that you can easily supply every crewmember+crewmembers dog with 2 adv cutters each, shit like blob/xeno(near space most of the time) and other large threat antags that end up getting obliterated by this garbage that they cant even prevent because god knows at least 3 people are dual wielding them already and probably the cargo staff too.",,1,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,1,1,0,0,178053,02ed75841c2a7d77957061612342307f0a290f41,2018-05-23 06:40:49 UTC,FALSE

This allows you to declare a function with a name of your choice (say
`foo`), but have clang treat it as if it were a builtin function (say
`__builtin_foo`), by writing

  static __inline__ __attribute__((__clang_arm_mve_alias(__builtin_foo)))
  int foo(args);

I'm intending to use this for the ACLE intrinsics for MVE, which have
to be polymorphic on their argument types and also need to be
implemented by builtins. To avoid having to implement the polymorphism
with several layers of nested _Generic and make error reporting
hideous, I want to make all the user-facing intrinsics correspond
directly to clang builtins, so that after clang resolves
__attribute__((overloadable)) polymorphism it's already holding the
right BuiltinID for the intrinsic it selected.

However, this commit itself just introduces the new attribute, and
doesn't use it for anything.

To avoid unanticipated side effects if this attribute is used to make
aliases to other builtins, there's a restriction mechanism: only
(BuiltinID, alias) pairs that are approved by the function
ArmMveAliasValid() will be permitted. At present, that function
doesn't permit anything, because the Tablegen that will generate its
list of valid pairs isn't yet implemented. So the only test of this
facility is one that checks that an unapproved builtin _can't_ be
aliased.

Most functions in idr fail to deal with the high bits when the idr
tree grows to the maximum height.

* idr_get_empty_slot() stops growing idr tree once the depth reaches
  MAX_IDR_LEVEL - 1, which is one depth shallower than necessary to
  cover the whole range.  The function doesn't even notice that it
  didn't grow the tree enough and ends up allocating the wrong ID
  given sufficiently high @starting_id.

  For example, on 64 bit, if the starting id is 0x7fffff01,
  idr_get_empty_slot() will grow the tree 5 layer deep, which only
  covers the 30 bits and then proceed to allocate as if the bit 30
  wasn't specified.  It ends up allocating 0x3fffff01 without the bit
  30 but still returns 0x7fffff01.

* __idr_remove_all() will not remove anything if the tree is fully
  grown.

* idr_find() can't find anything if the tree is fully grown.

* idr_for_each() and idr_get_next() can't iterate anything if the tree
  is fully grown.

Fix it by introducing idr_max() which returns the maximum possible ID
given the depth of tree and replacing the id limit checks in all
affected places.

As the idr_layer pointer array pa[] needs to be 1 larger than the
maximum depth, enlarge pa[] arrays by one.

While this plugs the discovered issues, the whole code base is
horrible and in desparate need of rewrite.  It's fragile like hell,

About The Pull Request

this just makes fire axes smash windows properly again. not much to say.
Why It's Good For The Game

I don't think I can call the fire axe nerf intended, but even if it is, it was unwarranted if the rwindow buffs were supposed to do what they were supposed to do. Only places that get fire axes are atmos and bridge. for atmos, it does fuck all since atmos can easily get an rcd anyways. CE, HOP, HOS, and cap give minimal shits about reinforced windows anyways, and the RD has access to tools, so it just changes much for the CMO. the fire axe is especially crucial now that any douchebag can cover a hall in impenetrable windows. It's physically painful to watch a ce try to clean that up himself. this won't break windows much faster than an RCD, but it is cheaper. Note that a fire axe can currently break windows at similar speeds to a pre changes toolbox.

Some targets need 4K sectors for small flash chips (e.g. some
routerboards, where the entire chip is just one ""erase block""), whereas
on other devices 4K sectors lead to horrible flash erase/write
performance.

Set the default limit in the generic kernel configuration to 4 MiB to
ensure that all new platforms don't use 4K sectors for bigger flash
chips. On all existing targets use 16 MiB for now to avoid regressions.
They will be changed individually in follow-up commits.

Once upon a time, 4b9584fdb14fc3 already fixed this problem: We have to
set the border width to zero before applying the new geometry to the
client, because changing the border width makes the client move
according to its gravity.

Then came e54387904b16e3 and made this code use awful.placement instead
of just fullscreening the client itself (without explaining why in the
commit message!). After this commit, the border width was just ignored
and left as-is. This was then fixed in 0bf8bb6a64638dec0e (no idea which
callback the commit message refers to, the old code was basically just
c.border_width=0, c:geometry(screen_geo)). However, now the border width
was again changed after the geometry and the bug that was fixed by
4b9584fdb14fc3 was back.

This commit fixes this regression again by making sure that the border
width is set to zero before the geometry is set. This becomes slightly
more complicated, because now it is also awful.placement's job to
restore the old border width.

This is why this commit adds a new option to awful.placement so that it
sets the border width to zero after creating its memento of the old
border width.

BLAS.

This change introduces four flows: mac, linux, dataproc, cluster. Each page's
complexity matches the true complexity of installing Hail on that platform. In
particular, note how simple the Linux and Mac OS X pages are.

It also clears up the ""other cluster"" case. Our current docs are too complex and
don't push people towards simple solutions.

The API and code have been through various bits of initial review by
serial driver people but they definitely need to live somewhere for a
while so the unconverted drivers can get knocked into shape, existing
drivers that have been updated can be better tuned and bugs whacked out.

This replaces the tty flip buffers with kmalloc objects in rings. In the
normal situation for an IRQ driven serial port at typical speeds the
behaviour is pretty much the same, two buffers end up allocated and the
kernel cycles between them as before.

When there are delays or at high speed we now behave far better as the
buffer pool can grow a bit rather than lose characters. This also means
that we can operate at higher speeds reliably.

For drivers that receive characters in blocks (DMA based, USB and
especially virtualisation) the layer allows a lot of driver specific
code that works around the tty layer with private secondary queues to be
removed. The IBM folks need this sort of layer, the smart serial port
people do, the virtualisers do (because a virtualised tty typically
operates at infinite speed rather than emulating 9600 baud).

Finally many drivers had invalid and unsafe attempts to avoid buffer
overflows by directly invoking tty methods extracted out of the innards
of work queue structs. These are no longer needed and all go away. That
fixes various random hangs with serial ports on overflow.

The other change in here is to optimise the receive_room path that is
used by some callers. It turns out that only one ldisc uses receive room
except asa constant and it updates it far far less than the value is
read. We thus make it a variable not a function call.

I expect the code to contain bugs due to the size alone but I'll be
watching and squashing them and feeding out new patches as it goes.

Because the buffers now dynamically expand you should only run out of
buffering when the kernel runs out of memory for real.  That means a lot of
the horrible hacks high performance drivers used to do just aren't needed any
more.

Description:

tty_insert_flip_char is an old API and continues to work as before, as does
tty_flip_buffer_push() [this is why many drivers dont need modification].  It
does now also return the number of chars inserted

There are also

tty_buffer_request_room(tty, len)

which asks for a buffer block of the length requested and returns the space
found.  This improves efficiency with hardware that knows how much to
transfer.

and tty_insert_flip_string_flags(tty, str, flags, len)

to insert a string of characters and flags

For a smart interface the usual code is

    len = tty_request_buffer_room(tty, amount_hardware_says);
    tty_insert_flip_string(tty, buffer_from_card, len);

More description!

At the moment tty buffers are attached directly to the tty.  This is causing a
lot of the problems related to tty layer locking, also problems at high speed
and also with bursty data (such as occurs in virtualised environments)

I'm working on ripping out the flip buffers and replacing them with a pool of
dynamically allocated buffers.  This allows both for old style ""byte I/O""
devices and also helps virtualisation and smart devices where large blocks of
data suddenely materialise and need storing.

So far so good.  Lots of drivers reference tty->flip.*.  Several of them also
call directly and unsafely into function pointers it provides.  This will all
break.  Most drivers can use tty_insert_flip_char which can be kept as an API
but others need more.

At the moment I've added the following interfaces, if people think more will
be needed now is a good time to say

 int tty_buffer_request_room(tty, size)

Try and ensure at least size bytes are available, returns actual room (may be
zero).  At the moment it just uses the flipbuf space but that will change.
Repeated calls without characters being added are not cumulative.  (ie if you
call it with 1, 1, 1, and then 4 you'll have four characters of space.  The
other functions will also try and grow buffers in future but this will be a
more efficient way when you know block sizes.

 int tty_insert_flip_char(tty, ch, flag)

As before insert a character if there is room.  Now returns 1 for success, 0
for failure.

 int tty_insert_flip_string(tty, str, len)

Insert a block of non error characters.  Returns the number inserted.

 int tty_prepare_flip_string(tty, strptr, len)

Adjust the buffer to allow len characters to be added.  Returns a buffer
pointer in strptr and the length available.  This allows for hardware that
needs to use functions like insl or mencpy_fromio.

In the future I'd like to use this to auto-generate Typescript web-service wrappers based on C# DTO.

I have done much research into code generation solutions for .NET, but no code generation does things very well. Therefore, I have build my own code generation solution.

I have attempted:
- T4 (already in use) - only works in Visual Studio, using it to generate code based on existing code has an horrible API
- Scripty - does not work currently in .NET Core and is subject to change due to upcoming rewrite. Also does not provide proper intellisense.
- Scriptcs - same as scripty

My solution has a different approach:
- Use Roslyn to design-time compile the project
- Walk the Roslyn symbol tree to find the interesting parts (semantic model)
- Generate the code using Razor, embedded.

Razor however has proper built-in Intellisense, and for the most part, the hardcore code is written as C# library code which has (of course) perfect intellisense and debuggability. We reuse a part of the MVC Razor pipeline to generate the proper C# code for the Razor template, then compile that using the assemblies already loaded in the application domain. The only disadvantage of Razor is that R# goes haywire with the indentation.

One of the longest standing areas for improvement in ASoC has been the
DAPM algorithm - it repeats the same checks many times whenever it is run
and makes no effort to limit the areas of the graph it checks meaning we
do an awful lot of walks over the full graph. This has never mattered too
much as the size of the graph has generally been small in relation to the
size of the devices supported and the speed of CPUs but it is annoying.

In preparation for work on improving this insert a trace point after the
graph walk has been done. This gives us specific timing information for
the walk, and in order to give quantifiable (non-benchmark) numbers also
count every time we check a link or check the power for a widget and report
those numbers. Substantial changes in the algorithm may require tweaks to
the stats but they should be useful for simpler things.

Each ""page"" can show one or more forms for changing preferences.

The biggest change in content is the Groups page. Instead of a terrible
flat list of checkboxes, we now display every group in a clean list,
with buttons for dynamically joining or leaving the group. The group is
also filterable, making it easy to find a group you want.

The whole infrastructure is designed to be extensible. While the hooks
aren't there yet, everything below them are. Pages can be registered or
unregistered, and the forms on a page can also be registered or
unregistered. This will later let extensions provide their own
preferences for each user.

* Separate colors

* More consistent layout

* Remove many explicit color settings and make the style dependent on a few base colors

* Remove color gradients for controls

* Add custom application icons in the same style as existing MaterialDesignIcon

* Fix transparent cell borders for main-table

* Change some icons for consistent visual weight and additional adaptions

In the main toolbar, I changed the ""New File"" icon because it was an
outlined version while Open and Save is a filled version. For the Open
icon I would like to have the ""folder-open"", but that is currently not included
in our version.

I changed the Add Entry icon to a filled version as well, since it better fits
the trash. Unfortunately, there is no filled version of Copy and Paste and the
positively filled version of GitHub looks just awful.

I changed the Up, Down, and Close icon for the sidepanel and the entry editor
to versions that look visually more similar in size. Especially, the up and down
was too small.

After correspondence with a friend, I changed the default list item before the
groups into something not so heavy. The small triangle with its vertical side on the
left gives additionally a better impression of the indentation which is the
key here.

The Add Group icon was changed into a heavier circled version. It
now matches the style of the close button of the sidepanel and entry editor.

All icons of ""sub toolbars"" in the entry editor and the side panel have now
an equal size of 16px.

The preferred height of the side-panel header and the header of the tab-pane
was adjusted so that they match and there is no jump between main-table and
side-panel anymore. There might be a better way to do this.

Finally, the color of the overflow buttons for toolbar and tab-pane was
adjusted.

* Reduce the brightness of highlighted menu, marked text, etc

Slightly reducing this color still looks very nice and it gives a better
impression when text is marked.

* Fix icon sizes of the custom TTF

* Fix OO and Emacs icon.

Additionally, an alternative version for Vim was added and slight
improvements on other icons.

* Fix size of Copy and Paste icon to original one.

current IR-level pass.

The old SjLj EH pass has some problems, especially with the new EH model. Most
significantly, it violates some of the new restrictions the new model has. For
instance, the 'dispatch' table wants to jump to the landing pad, but we cannot
allow that because only an invoke's unwind edge can jump to a landing pad. This
requires us to mangle the code something awful. In addition, we need to keep the
now dead landingpad instructions around instead of CSE'ing them because the
DWARF emitter uses that information (they are dead because no control flow edge
will execute them - the control flow edge from an invoke's unwind is superceded
by the edge coming from the dispatch).

Basically, this pass belongs not at the IR level where SSA is king, but at the
code-gen level, where we have more flexibility.

apply_filters_to_query was performing an outerjoin to rbac_entries
unconditionally when model_query could have already performed an
outerjoin (if the request was from an unprivileged user) and/or when
the join wasn't even necessary (the '?shared=False' query that uses
a subquery and not a join). This resulted in terrible performance
because of cartesian products of rbac entries with themselves.

This fixes the issue by ensuring there is only an outerjoin to the
rbac table if it's going to be used for a filter condition and it's
not already joined because of a query scope imposed due to the user
not being privileged.

Unfortunately this doesn't include tests to prevent regressions because
we don't have any methods for testing the performance of individual
queries.

btrfs_start_delalloc_inodes will just walk the list of delalloc inodes and
start writing them out, but it doesn't splice the list or anything so as
long as somebody is doing work on the box you could end up in this section
_forever_.  So just remove it, it's not needed anyway since sync will start
writeback on all inodes anyway, all we need to do is wait for ordered
extents and then we can commit the transaction.  In my horrible torture test
sync goes from taking 4 minutes to about 1.5 minutes.  Thanks,

After a lot of time using kcond for tasklets, it turned out that, ultimately,
it was a pretty bad idea. Especially after introducing the threaded interrupt
handling: that opened the pandora box by allowing changing tasks' state
directly from the interrupt handlers (which run even when the is preemption
disabled, of course). That caused all the code iterating over state lists
to become suddently 'bugged', because it wasn't true anymore that a task
in the 'sleeping' list must always be in the sleepling state (an interrupt
might have changed that, under our feet). Keeping the interrupts disabled
while iterating all over the state lists couldn't be a good solution of
course, due to its terrible side-effects. Smart hacks disabling the
interrupts inside the loop for certain cases were the dirty-hacks used
until now. Today, a new approach fixed the problem at the root by stating
axiomatically that:

	""The state lists shall never change in interrupt handlers""

Because task's state is inevitably linked with the state list it currently
belongs to, in order to satisfy our new axiom a small sacrifice had to be
made: some tasks are *special*. Those *special* tasks will just not
partecipate in any state list as they actually don't even need to because
they're schedulated in a special way. Only the tasklet runners shall be
considered *special* tasks. This allowed the enqueue_tasklet_int() function
to wake-up a runner by just changing its task state (now atomic). Clearly,
this ""special tasks"" approach has a significant CON:

	""Code just iterating over the state lists won't notice the runners""

Hopefully, this won't become a real problem, after making all the sync
primitives to work smoothly without using the state lists.

tcpwrap is legacy code, that is barely maintained upstream. It's APIs
are awful, and the feature set it exposes (such as DNS and IDENT
access control) questionnable. We should not support this natively in
systemd.

Hence, let's remove the code. If people want to continue making use of
this, they can do so by plugging in ""tcpd"" for the processes they start.
With that scheme things are as well or badly supported as they were from
traditional inetd, hence no functionality is really lost.

The code in C4::Matches::get_matches is terrible and a bug has been introduced
by bug 12478 because of its way to handle uniqueness.

If search engine is elastic, simple_search_compat returns array ref of MARC::Record,
used as a string for the key of the matches hashref we get things like
""MARC::Record=HASH(0x8f76ab0)"".
Yes, terrible...

The file is never staged and we get an internal server error:
    stage-marc-import.pl: Can't locate object method ""fields"" via package ""MARC::Record=HASH(0x8f76ab0)"" (perhaps you forgot to load ""MARC::Record=HASH(0x8f76ab0)""?) at /home/vagrant/kohaclone/C4/Biblio.pm line 2691

To recreate the issue:
- Set SearchEngine == Elastic
- Create a matching rule on 999$c (you need to edit the existing one and specify
'Local-number' as search index, not 'local-number')
- Import a file with bibliographic records and use the matching rule you defined.

Test plan:
Import authority and bibliographic records with Zebra and Elastic using a matching rule.
Everything should work correctly.

Note: I found a bug when importing authorities using Elastic, see bug 17255 comment 38.

tcpwrap is legacy code, that is barely maintained upstream. It's APIs
are awful, and the feature set it exposes (such as DNS and IDENT
access control) questionnable. We should not support this natively in
systemd.

Hence, let's remove the code. If people want to continue making use of
this, they can do so by plugging in ""tcpd"" for the processes they start.
With that scheme things are as well or badly supported as they were from
traditional inetd, hence no functionality is really lost.

Printing kernel text addresses in stack dumps is of questionable value,
especially now that address randomization is becoming common.

It can be a security issue because it leaks kernel addresses.  It also
affects the usefulness of the stack dump.  Linus says:

  ""I actually spend time cleaning up commit messages in logs, because
  useless data that isn't actually information (random hex numbers) is
  actively detrimental.

  It makes commit logs less legible.

  It also makes it harder to parse dumps.

  It's not useful. That makes it actively bad.

  I probably look at more oops reports than most people. I have not
  found the hex numbers useful for the last five years, because they are
  just randomized crap.

  The stack content thing just makes code scroll off the screen etc, for
  example.""

The only real downside to removing these addresses is that they can be
used to disambiguate duplicate symbol names.  However such cases are
rare, and the context of the stack dump should be enough to be able to
figure it out.

There's now a 'faddr2line' script which can be used to convert a
function address to a file name and line:

  $ ./scripts/faddr2line ~/k/vmlinux write_sysrq_trigger+0x51/0x60
  write_sysrq_trigger+0x51/0x60:
  write_sysrq_trigger at drivers/tty/sysrq.c:1098

Or gdb can be used:

  $ echo ""list *write_sysrq_trigger+0x51"" |gdb ~/k/vmlinux |grep ""is in""
  (gdb) 0xffffffff815b5d83 is in driver_probe_device (/home/jpoimboe/git/linux/drivers/base/dd.c:378).

(But note that when there are duplicate symbol names, gdb will only show
the first symbol it finds.  faddr2line is recommended over gdb because
it handles duplicates and it also does function size checking.)

Here's an example of what a stack dump looks like after this change:

addItems() calls jQuery's .add(), which deduplicates the added
elements with the elements already in the collection. This is
the equivalent of a nested for loop: it runs in O(n^2) time and
the comparsions are expensive.

We could maintain $items as a plain array instead, but we don't really
need it, so just remove it (and fix the one place where it was used).

The other usage of .add() is to gather the elements to add into a
temporary jQuery collection, so do that in an array instead.

This make the addItems() call in the LanguageResultWidget constructor
(~300 items) go from ~12 seconds to ~25ms.

Bonus: make insertion at an offset in the middle saner, it only
worked because .add() sorts elements, which is a horrible thing
to rely on.

The pkeys changes brought about a truly hideous set of macros in:

  cde70140fed8 (""mm/gup: Overload get_user_pages() functions"")

... which macros are (ab-)using the fact that __VA_ARGS__ can be used
to shift parameter positions in macro arguments without breaking the
build and so can be used to call separate C functions depending on
the number of arguments of the macro.

This allowed easy migration of these 3 GUP APIs, as both these variants
worked at the C level:

  old:
	ret = get_user_pages(current, current->mm, address, 1, 1, 0, &page, NULL);

  new:
	ret = get_user_pages(address, 1, 1, 0, &page, NULL);

... while we also generated a (functionally harmless but noticeable) build
time warning if the old API was used. As there are over 300 uses of these
APIs, this trick eased the migration of the API and avoided excessive
migration pain in linux-next.

Now, with its work done, get rid of all of that complication and ugliness:

    3 files changed, 16 insertions(+), 140 deletions(-)

... where the linecount of the migration hack was further inflated by the
fact that there are NOMMU variants of these GUP APIs as well.

Much of the conversion was done in linux-next over the past couple of months,
and Linus recently removed all remaining old API uses from the upstream tree
in the following upstrea commit:

  cb107161df3c (""Convert straggling drivers to new six-argument get_user_pages()"")

There was one more old-API usage in mm/gup.c, in the CONFIG_HAVE_GENERIC_RCU_GUP
code path that ARM, ARM64 and PowerPC uses.

After this commit any old API usage will break the build.

[ Also fixed a PowerPC/HAVE_GENERIC_RCU_GUP warning reported by Stephen Rothwell. ]

Gang Machineguns now track the mouse location of the first buckled person (For those who don't code, that means the person using it)

Gang Machineguns will automatically aim and turn towards whatever that person is pointing at.. 
However, to make it target something specifically instead of a direction, you still have to hold your mouse down while firing.

Gang machineguns will no longer cause the user to shit out bullets if they unbuckle during firing :^)

We still load the surface into an StImageContent, but instead of
adding the content to an actor we hand out, return the content
itself (as GIcon).

That means we lose the ability to specify an icon size, but as we
get the pixel data from a fixed-size surface anyway, that shouldn't
matter much in practice.

Not to mention that the function is only used for fallback X11 icons,
which are already shit more often than not.

This patch adds call number, collection code and shelving location to
the filter.

To test:

It is of course a prerequisite to have items in the DB with the correct
MARC fields and that they have been checked out etc. to get a valid
result when testing.

1. Apply patch to koha synced to master.
2. Go to /cgi-bin/koha/reports/cat_issues_top.pl
3. Select filters, the new ones are Call number, Collection code and
   Shelving location
4. Hit submit.

Expected result:
The filters chosen will be printed under ""Filtered on"".
A table with the result is shown.

For manual verification here is some SQL to run:

SELECT DISTINCT biblio.title, COUNT(biblio.biblionumber) AS RANK, biblio.biblionumber AS ID, itemcallnumber as CALLNUM, ccode as CCODE, location as LOC FROM `old_issues`
                  LEFT JOIN items USING(itemnumber)
                  LEFT JOIN biblio USING(biblionumber)
                  LEFT JOIN biblioitems USING(biblionumber)
                  LEFT JOIN borrowers USING(borrowernumber)
                  WHERE 1 AND biblioitems.itemtype like 'BK' AND itemcallnumber like '005.2/762' AND ccode like 'NFIC' AND location like 'CART' AND borrowers.categorycode like 'PT' group by biblio.biblionumber order by RANK DESC;

Put in your valid values in the WHERE clause for the values in the
single quotes ''.

  It works as described. Valid results, tested in various combinations.
  Follows the coding (awful) style of the original script, without
  introducing any regression. It would have been great to have
  callnumber interval, but anyway...

and in the target shuffle combining when trying to widen vector
elements.

Previously only one of these was correct, and we didn't correctly
propagate zeroing target shuffle masks (which have a different sentinel
value from undef in non- target shuffle masks now). This isn't just
a missed optimization, this caused us to drop zeroing shuffles on the
floor and miscompile code. The added test case is one example of that.

There are other fixes to the test suite as a consequence of this as well
as restoring the undef elements in some of the masks that were lost when
I brought sanity to the actual *value* of the undef and zero sentinels.

I've also just cleaned up some of the PSHUFD and PSHUFLW and PSHUFHW
combining code, but that code really needs to go. It was a nice initial
attempt, but it isn't very principled and the recursive shuffle combiner
is much more powerful.

The goal here is to replace some of the subtotals/lttsubtotals/lttsummary

tax exemptions and CASE WHEN statements are a terrible tool for that
job. A commented for loop makes it a lot clearer what's actually

provided by subtotals. Once I have this live, I want to gather some
real transaction data and audit the totals to make sure they match.

Looking at the XML of the two dives Szymon Kosecki sent out to the
subsurface list, I notice that our cylinder size conversion was wrong.
It looks like CYLINDERUNITS is what determines whether the cylinder size
is in metric (0) or imperial (1) units.

Of course, if you gave a cylinder size in cuft and didn't give a working
pressure, subsurface will just ignore the size as the random crap it is.
We *could* default to a working pressure of 3000 psi, of course.

This also picks up the CYLINDERDESCRIPTION value, although neither of
Szymon's dives actually had any description.

I need more SDE xml files to figure out how multi-cylinder dives look
etc, but I think this gets most *simple* SDE files converted almost
correctly now.

invariant instructions to be both more correct and much more powerful.

While testing, I continued to find issues with sinking post-load
hardening. Unfortunately, it was amazingly hard to create any useful
tests of this because we were mostly sinking across copies and other
loading instructions. The fact that we couldn't sink past normal
arithmetic was really a big oversight.

So first, I've ported roughly the same set of instructions from the data
invariant loads to also have their non-loading varieties understood to
be data invariant. I've also added a few instructions that came up so
often it again made testing complicated: inc, dec, and lea.

With this, I was able to shake out a few nasty bugs in the validity
checking. We need to restrict to hardening single-def instructions with
defined registers that match a particular form: GPRs that don't have
a NOREX constraint directly attached to their register class.

The (tiny!) test case included catches all of the issues I was seeing
(once we can sink the hardening at all) except for the NOREX issue. The
only test I have there is horrible. It is large, inexplicable, and
doesn't even produce an error unless you try to emit encodings. I can
keep looking for a way to test it, but I'm out of ideas really.

Thanks to Ben for giving me at least a sanity-check review. I'll follow
up with Craig to go over this more thoroughly post-commit, but without
it SLH crashes everywhere so landing it for now.

but it would be nice to emit the type at the call, so we know what we asked for!

ZNC uses a map to cache channel memebers on join. Unfortunately uclibc++
uses a naive linked-list implementation with horrible performance, which
can cause joins to take a few minutes on popular channels.

Therefore Switch to libstdc++ which uses a much more performant hashmap.
ZNC by itself is already rather large, so the added footprint of
libstd++ vs uclibc++ does not matter that much anyway.

Should fix #11778.

First, don't combine bit masking into vector shuffles (even ones the
target can handle) once operation legalization has taken place. Custom
legalization of vector shuffles may exist for these patterns (making the
predicate return true) but that custom legalization may in some cases
produce the exact bit math this matches. We only really want to handle
this prior to operation legalization.

However, the x86 backend, in a fit of awesome, relied on this. What it
would do is mark VSELECTs as expand, which would turn them into
arithmetic, which this would then match back into vector shuffles, which
we would then lower properly. Amazing.

Instead, the second change is to teach the x86 backend to directly form
vector shuffles from VSELECT nodes with constant conditions, and to mark
all of the vector types we support lowering blends as shuffles as custom
VSELECT lowering. We still mark the forms which actually support
variable blends as *legal* so that the custom lowering is bypassed, and
the legal lowering can even be used by the vector shuffle legalization
(yes, i know, this is confusing. but that's how the patterns are
written).

This makes the VSELECT lowering much more sensible, and in fact should
fix a bunch of bugs with it. However, as you'll see in the test cases,
right now what it does is point out the *hilarious* deficiency of the
new vector shuffle lowering when it comes to blends. Fortunately, my
very next patch fixes that. I can't submit it yet, because that patch,
somewhat obviously, forms the exact and/or pattern that the DAG combine
is matching here! Without this patch, teaching the vector shuffle
lowering to produce the right code infloops in the DAG combiner. With
this patch alone, we produce terrible code but at least lower through
the right paths. With both patches, all the regressions here should be
fixed, and a bunch of the improvements (like using 2 shufps with no
memory loads instead of 2 andps with memory loads and an orps) will
stay. Win!

There is one other change worth noting here. We had hilariously wrong
vectorization cost estimates for vselect because we fell through to the
code path that assumed all ""expand"" vector operations are scalarized.
However, the ""expand"" lowering of VSELECT is vector bit math, most
definitely not scalarized. So now we go back to the correct if horribly
naive cost of ""1"" for ""not scalarized"". If anyone wants to add actual
modeling of shuffle costs, that would be cool, but this seems an
improvement on its own. Note the removal of 16 and 32 ""costs"" for doing
a blend. Even in SSE2 we can blend in fewer than 16 instructions. ;] Of
course, we don't right now because of OMG bad code, but I'm going to fix
that. Next patch. I promise.

This time the issue is fortunately just a simple mistake rather than a horrible
design spectre. I thought SUBS/SBCS provided sufficient NZCV flags for
comparing two 64-bit values, but they don't.

The fix is slightly clunkier in AArch64 because we can't use conditional
execution to emit a pair of CMPs. Traditionally an ""icmp ne i128"" would map to
an EOR/EOR/ORR/CBNZ, but that uses more registers so it's easier to go with a
CSET/CINC/CBNZ combination. Slightly less efficient, but this is -O0 anyway.

Thanks to Anton Korobeynikov for pointing out the issue.

operations.

Specifically, we had code that tried to badly approximate reconstructing
all of the possible variations on addressing modes in two x86
instructions based on those in one pseudo instruction. This is not the
first bug uncovered with doing this, so stop doing it altogether.
Instead generically and pedantically copy every operand from the address
over to both new instructions, and strip kill flags from any register
operands.

This fixes a subtle bug seen in the wild where we would mysteriously
drop parts of the addressing mode, causing for example the index
argument in the added test case to just be completely ignored.

Hypothetically, this was an extremely bad miscompile because it actually
caused a predictable and leveragable write of a 64bit quantity to an
unintended offset (the first element of the array intead of whatever
other element was intended). As a consequence, in theory this could even
have introduced security vulnerabilities.

However, this was only something that could happen with an atomic
floating point add. No other operation could trigger this bug, so it
seems extremely unlikely to have occured widely in the wild.

But it did in fact occur, and frequently in scientific applications
which were using relaxed atomic updates of a floating point value after
adding a delta. Those would end up being quite badly miscompiled by
LLVM, which is how we found this. Of course, this often looks like
a race condition in the code, but it was actually a miscompile.

I suspect that this whole RELEASE_FADD thing was a complete mistake.
There is no such operation, and I worry that anything other than add
will get remarkably worse codegeneration. But that's not for this
change....

Inho, the safety rules for vnr/nr_ns helpers are horrible and buggy.

task_pid_nr_ns(task) needs rcu/tasklist depending on task == current.

As for ""special"" pids, vnr/nr_ns helpers always need rcu.  However, if
task != current, they are unsafe even under rcu lock, we can't trust
task->group_leader without the special checks.

And almost every helper has a callsite which needs a fix.

Also, it is a bit annoying that the implementations of, say,
task_pgrp_vnr() and task_pgrp_nr_ns() are not ""symmetrical"".

This patch introduces the new helper, __task_pid_nr_ns(), which is always
safe to use, and turns all other helpers into the trivial wrappers.

After this I'll send another patch which converts task_tgid_xxx() as well,
they're are a bit special.

-- Setting someone as special character (like wizard) does not equip him/her automatically. You have to do it it next step. Note, that in case of wizards and nuke operatives their old dress will be deleted! If you do not want it you shall use ""undress"" link.

-- You can unemad borgs!
-- You cannot unemag borgs because calling mind editor for nonhumans is blocked atm.
-- many other useful features.
-- you can fix burned out flashes from mind editor.

For coders:
- /datum/game_mode/malfunction/AI_Module renamed to /datum/AI_Module. Reason: What. The. Fuck.

Unrelated fixes:
- Blueprints can create areas up to 300 tiles (was 100).
- Cyborgs wont leave backpacks at spawn point anymore.
- Fixed bug in preferences causing preferences files to be huge.
- Diseases can infect again.
- The option ""SQL_ENABLED 0"" now works in config.txt.
- fixed critical bug on assassinate objective.

Bugs:
- We have a bug with job distribution for people who haven't any available jobs in their preferences. Players tends to group by jobs.
- For example, if we have 3 players they with hight chances will got same jobs. And probability of having one engineer and one medic _exactly_ equals _zero_.
- I am not sure if my changes made that bug worse. Anyway I MUST do this commit. Bug will be fixed eventually. Maybe.

search_binary_handler() uses ""for (try=0; try<2; try++)"" to avoid ""goto""
but the code looks too complicated and horrible imho.  We still need to
check ""try == 0"" before request_module() and add the additional ""break""
for !CONFIG_MODULES case.

Kill this loop and use a simple ""bool need_retry"" + ""goto retry"".  The
code looks much simpler and we do not even need ifdef's, gcc can optimize
out the ""if (need_retry)"" block if !IS_ENABLED().

This patch refactors the utility functions and classes around the construction
of a bug path.

At a very high level, this consists of 3 steps:

* For all BugReports in the same BugReportEquivClass, collect all their error
nodes in a set. With that set, create a new, trimmed ExplodedGraph whose leafs
are all error nodes.
* Until a valid report is found, construct a bug path, which is yet another
ExplodedGraph, that is linear from a given error node to the root of the graph.
* Run all visitors on the constructed bug path. If in this process the report
got invalidated, start over from step 2.

Now, to the changes within this patch:

* Do not allow the invalidation of BugReports up to the point where the trimmed
graph is constructed. Checkers shouldn't add bug reports that are known to be
invalid, and should use visitors and argue about the entirety of the bug path if
needed.
* Do not calculate indices. I may be biased, but I personally find code like
this horrible. I'd like to point you to one of the comments in the original code:

SmallVector<const ExplodedNode *, 32> errorNodes;
for (const auto I : bugReports) {
  if (I->isValid()) {
    HasValid = true;
    errorNodes.push_back(I->getErrorNode());
  } else {
    // Keep the errorNodes list in sync with the bugReports list.
    errorNodes.push_back(nullptr);
  }
}

Not on my watch. Instead, use a far easier to follow trick: store a pointer to
the BugReport in question, not an index to it.

* Add range iterators to ExplodedGraph's successors and predecessors, and a
visitor range to BugReporter.
* Rename TrimmedGraph to BugPathGetter. Because that is what it has always been:
no sane graph type should store an iterator-like state, or have an interface not
exposing a single graph-like functionalities.
* Rename ReportGraph to BugPathInfo, because it is only a linear path with some
other context.
* Instead of having both and out and in parameter (which I think isn't ever
excusable unless we use the out-param for caching), return a record object with
descriptive getter methods.
* Where descriptive names weren't sufficient, compliment the code with comments.

The result of this last form slipping through was some confusing logic
in IsStandardConversion handling of these resolved address-of
expressions which eventually exploded in an assert. Simplify this logic
a bit and add some more aggressive asserts to catch improperly formed
expressions getting into this routine.

Finally add systematic testing of member functions, both static and
non-static, in the various forms they can take. One of these is
essentially PR9563, and this commit fixes the crash in that PR. However,
the diagnostics for this are still pretty terrible. We at least are now
accepting the correct constructs and rejecting the invalid ones rather
than accepting invalid or crashing as before.

AWS t2 instance types have burstable CPU performance. They accumulate
""credits"" when not doing anything and then can consume the credits when they
want to do CPU intensive work. When the credits run out, the instance will
not be able to do CPU intensive work and will slow down. We want to know
when this happens because it is normally correlates to another problem/alert
and may indicate that we need to change the instance type in future.

Writing this alert turned out to be much less trivial than I'd hoped. I no
longer feel so strongly about the usefulness of this, but it's probably
better than nothing and needing to lookup the information ourselves.

We have two metrics from the DataDog EC2 integration:

- `cpucredit_balance`: how many credits are available
- `cpucredit_usage`: how quickly an instance is consuming the balance

Each t2 instance type has slightly different characteristics in how many
credits they start of with, how they are used, how quickly they are
replenished, and how many can be kept in balance.

Ideally we would alert on the likelihood of the balance being exhausted in
the near future, but DataDog isn't able to do calculations based on two
metrics and we don't have (programmatic) information about the different
instance types.

So what we've settled on is an informational alert that will tell us when an
instance is very close to or has already exhausted it's credits. This will
allow us to correlate the information with other alerts that may be related.
The initial balance is 30 credits for `t2.{nano,micro,small}` instances and
60 credits for `t2.{medium,large}` instances, so I've set the warning
threshold to be below the minimum. The value and window should prevent
false-positives from newly created instances. The critical threshold needs
to be greater than 0 because exhausted instances will never average to
exactly 0.

The edit page for the monitor warns about the following:

> Note: The selected metric provides data at low frequencies, we strongly recommend alerting on a 1 hour timeframe.

I haven't used 1h because it seems very large and will take a long time for
the monitor to either trigger or recover. The data points seem to be 1~3mins
apart, which doesn't seem terrible, so I've compromised on a window of 30m.

I've used `avg():` instead of `min():` so that it doesn't take an incredibly
long time for the monitor to recover when credits are replenished. I don't
think the second `:avg:` has any effect because the `by` clause separates
each instance.

We have decided not to add a separate monitor for RDS at this stage because
we don't currently have any t2 instances for of our Cloud Foundry
installation. If we do add it the future then it's worth noting that the
metrics appear to be tagged only with `aws_account` and not `deploy_env`
like the EC2 metrics are.

Fix ""system goes unresponsive under memory pressure and lots of
dirty/writeback pages"" bug.

	http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/4/4/86

In the above thread, Andreas Mohr described that

	Invoking any command locked up for minutes (note that I'm
	talking about attempted additional I/O to the _other_,
	_unaffected_ main system HDD - such as loading some shell
	binaries -, NOT the external SSD18M!!).

This happens when the two conditions are both meet:
- under memory pressure
- writing heavily to a slow device

OOM also happens in Andreas' system.  The OOM trace shows that 3 processes
are stuck in wait_on_page_writeback() in the direct reclaim path.  One in
do_fork() and the other two in unix_stream_sendmsg().  They are blocked on
this condition:

	(sc->order && priority < DEF_PRIORITY - 2)

which was introduced in commit 78dc583d (vmscan: low order lumpy reclaim
also should use PAGEOUT_IO_SYNC) one year ago.  That condition may be too
permissive.  In Andreas' case, 512MB/1024 = 512KB.  If the direct reclaim
for the order-1 fork() allocation runs into a range of 512KB
hard-to-reclaim LRU pages, it will be stalled.

It's a severe problem in three ways.

Firstly, it can easily happen in daily desktop usage.  vmscan priority can
easily go below (DEF_PRIORITY - 2) on _local_ memory pressure.  Even if
the system has 50% globally reclaimable pages, it still has good
opportunity to have 0.1% sized hard-to-reclaim ranges.  For example, a
simple dd can easily create a big range (up to 20%) of dirty pages in the
LRU lists.  And order-1 to order-3 allocations are more than common with
SLUB.  Try ""grep -v '1 :' /proc/slabinfo"" to get the list of high order
slab caches.  For example, the order-1 radix_tree_node slab cache may
stall applications at swap-in time; the order-3 inode cache on most
filesystems may stall applications when trying to read some file; the
order-2 proc_inode_cache may stall applications when trying to open a
/proc file.

Secondly, once triggered, it will stall unrelated processes (not doing IO
at all) in the system.  This ""one slow USB device stalls the whole system""
avalanching effect is very bad.

Thirdly, once stalled, the stall time could be intolerable long for the
users.  When there are 20MB queued writeback pages and USB 1.1 is writing
them in 1MB/s, wait_on_page_writeback() will stuck for up to 20 seconds.
Not to mention it may be called multiple times.

So raise the bar to only enable PAGEOUT_IO_SYNC when priority goes below
DEF_PRIORITY/3, or 6.25% LRU size.  As the default dirty throttle ratio is
20%, it will hardly be triggered by pure dirty pages.  We'd better treat
PAGEOUT_IO_SYNC as some last resort workaround -- its stall time is so
uncomfortably long (easily goes beyond 1s).

The bar is only raised for (order < PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER) allocations,
which are easy to satisfy in 1TB memory boxes.  So, although 6.25% of
memory could be an awful lot of pages to scan on a system with 1TB of
memory, it won't really have to busy scan that much.

Andreas tested an older version of this patch and reported that it mostly
fixed his problem.  Mel Gorman helped improve it and KOSAKI Motohiro will
fix it further in the next patch.

It's still an obsolete interface; don't introduce those in new drivers.
However, it's saner than the ->proc_info() and commits after this one
will convert the existing ->proc_info() users to it.

The read side is ->show_info(seq_file *, struct Scsi_Host *); use
seq_... for generating contents.

The write side is ->write_info(struct Scsi_Host *, char *, int).

Again, this is driven by procfs needs; we are going to kill ->write_proc()
and ->read_proc() and this is the main obstacle to burying that piece of
shit.

This was done through the aid of a terrible Perl creation. I will not
paste any of the horrors here. Suffice to say, it require multiple
staged rounds of replacements, state carried between, and a few
nested-construct-parsing hacks that I'm not proud of. It happens, by
luck, to be able to deal with all the TCL-quoting patterns in evidence
in the LLVM test suite.

If anyone is maintaining large out-of-tree test trees, feel free to poke
me and I'll send you the steps I used to convert things, as well as
answer any painful questions etc. IRC works best for this type of thing
I find.

Once converted, switch the LLVM lit config to use ShTests the same as
Clang. In addition to being able to delete large amounts of Python code
from 'lit', this will also simplify the entire test suite and some of
lit's architecture.

Finally, the test suite runs 33% faster on Linux now. ;]

When the hw queue is busy, we shouldn't take requests from the scheduler
queue any more, otherwise it is difficult to do IO merge.

This patch fixes the awful IO performance on some SCSI devices(lpfc,
qla2xxx, ...) when mq-deadline/kyber is used by not taking requests if

Summary:
It was barely supported for a several years for now, somewhat
rotten and doesn't correspond to the way we build/test TSan runtime
in Clang anymore.

CMake build has proper compile flags, library layout, build
dependencies etc.

Shell scripts that depended on the output of Makefile.old are
either obsolete now (check_cmake.sh), or moved to lit tests
(check_memcpy.sh), or kept as a standalone scripts not suitable
for generic test suite, but invoked on bots (check_analyze.sh).

It is not used on bots anymore: all ""interesting"" configurations
(gcc/clang as a host compiler; debug/release build types) are now
tested via CMake.

actually manage the builtin header file includes as well as the system
ones.

This one is actually debatable whether it belongs in the driver or not,
as the builtin includes are really an internal bit of implementation
goop for Clang. However, they must be included at *exactly* the right
point in the sequence of header files, which makes it essentially
impossible to have this be managed by the Frontend and the rest by the
Driver. I have terrible ideas that would ""work"", but I think they're
worse than putting this in the driver and making the Frontend library
even more ignorant of the environment and system on which it is being
run.

Also fix the fact that we weren't properly respecting the flags which
suppress standard system include directories.

Note that this still leaves all of the Clang tests which run CC1
directly and include builtin header files broken on Windows. I'm working
on a followup patch to address that.

Summary:
Previously, when formatting a speculation error for printing, if we only had a single branch to the error, we'd replace the overall error's location with that of the branch. This is a bad idea. Not only does it claim that the primary location's error is positioned elsewhere than it actually is, but when checking the new `positioning.js` test file, we'd generate the following error:

```
Error ┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈ tests/error_printing/positioning.js:8:18

     11│ type X = $NonMaybeType<{|

       :
 [2] 18│     (<T: {+$refType: empty, ...}>(?T) => ?T) &

     24│ };
     25│
     26│ declare var x: $RelayProps<React$ElementConfig<(Props) => React.Node>, {}>;
```

One might expect, quite reasonably, that position `[1]` might be the primary location, or the `$PropertyType<T, '$refType'>` which is highlighted red on the CLI. In fact however, the primary location is on line 22, which only appears in the error by proximity to an included location. If the primary location were in a different file, it wouldn't appear in the error message at all. This is obviously terrible, so instead we don't replace the error's location with it's branch's, and thus correctly display the primary location.

It would be really good if anyone who remembers how this code works and
what it was intended to do could add some more obvious test coverage
instead of my completely contrived and reduced test case. My test case
was so brittle I left a bread crumb comment in it to help the next
person to stumble on it and not know what it was actually testing for.

This implements phase 1 of the proposal in #3579, moving the creation
of the pods, RCs, and services to the master after the apiserver is
available.

This is such a wide commit because our existing initial config story
is special:

* Add kube-addons service and associated salt configuration:
** We configure /etc/kubernetes/addons to be a directory of objects
that are appropriately configured for the current cluster.
** ""/etc/init.d/kube-addons start"" slurps up everything in that dir.
(Most of the difficult is the business logic in salt around getting
that directory built at all.)
** We cheat and overlay cluster/addons into saltbase/salt/kube-addons
as config files for the kube-addons meta-service.
* Change .yaml.in files to salt templates
* Rename {setup,teardown}-{monitoring,logging} to
{setup,teardown}-{monitoring,logging}-firewall to properly reflect
their real purpose now (the purpose of these functions is now ONLY to
bring up the firewall rules, and possibly to relay the IP to the user).
* Rework GCE {setup,teardown}-{monitoring,logging}-firewall: Both
functions were improperly configuring global rules, yet used
lifecycles tied to the cluster. Use $NODE_INSTANCE_PREFIX with the
rule. The logging rule needed a $NETWORK specifier. The monitoring
rule tried gcloud describe first, but given the instancing, this feels
like a waste of time now.
* Plumb ENABLE_CLUSTER_MONITORING, ENABLE_CLUSTER_LOGGING,
ELASTICSEARCH_LOGGING_REPLICAS and DNS_REPLICAS down to the master,
since these are needed there now.

(Desperately want just a yaml or json file we can share between
providers that has all this crap. Maybe #3525 is an answer?)

Huge caveats: I've gone pretty firm testing on GCE, including
twiddling the env variables and making sure the objects I expect to
come up, come up. I've tested that it doesn't break GKE bringup
somehow. But I haven't had a chance to test the other providers.

There is still some bug in the PPC TLS stuff that is not worked around.
I'm getting access to a machine to reproduce and debug this further.
There is some chance that I'll have to add a terrible workaround for
PPC.

There is also some problem with iOS, but I have no ability to really
evaluate what the issue is there. I'm leaving it to folks maintaining
that platform to suggest a path forward -- personally I don't see any
useful path forward that supports threading in LLVM but does so without
support for *very basic* TLS. Note that we don't need more than some
pointers, and we don't need constructors, destructors, or any of the
other fanciness which remains widely unimplemented.

Summary:
We have had at least three pieces of code (in DWARFAbbreviationDeclaration,
DWARFAcceleratorTable and DWARFDie) that have hand-rolled support for
dumping unknown dwarf enum values. While not terrible, they are a bit
distracting and enable small differences to creep in (Unknown_ffff vs.
Unknown_0xffff). I ended up needing to add a fourth place
(DWARFVerifier), so it seems it would be a good time to centralize.

This patch creates an alternative to the XXXString dumping functions in
the BinaryFormat library, which formats an unknown value as
DW_TYPE_unknown_1234, instead of just an empty string. It is based on
the formatv function, as that allows us to avoid materializing the
string for unknown values (and because this way I don't have to invent a
name for the new functions :P).

In this patch I add formatters for dwarf attributes, forms, tags, and
index attributes as these are the ones in use currently, but adding
other enums is straight-forward.

About The Pull Request

Redoing the pull request because it's changed so fucking much. Original over here #49550.

The Infiltrator Bundle is a sneaksuit set that allows the wearer the benefits of a decent armor set at a relatively low price of 6TC. The armor vest paired with the sneaksuit will equal a syndicate hardsuit, but only on the chest. It also carries none of the benefits of the hardsuit, such as EVA.

The bundle comes complete with the following items:

Infiltrator Helmet: It's a insidious helmet. Has flashproofing.
Infiltrator Vest: It's roughly equal to an armor vest, but a lot wearker against lasers and disablers.
Blood-red Sneaksuit: It's the highest armored undersuit in the game, at 10 across the board.
Infiltrator Balaclava: Equal to an explorer mask in armor, and has a diagnostic hud built in. It also distorts your voice, so you always come up as 'Unknown' when speaking, even when you have another ID on. Obviously has anti-syngery with the Agent Card, but you're not wearing this to disguise as other people.
Infiltrator Gloves: Special combat gloves that allow you to fireman carry people more quickly.
Sneakboots: They muffle your footsteps completely!
Carrying Case: Storage container for the full suit and guns if you have them. Guns not included.

Also includes the Sleepytime Pajama Bundle for nukies.

Zawo and I have been passing this between us for a while trying to get this into a good state. Hopefully now it's worth an inclusion.
Why It's Good For The Game

A cheaper alternative to the Syndicate Balloon to indicate to everyone around you that you are probably valid.

A recognizable outfit that proves to be useful in minor ways and provide cheap armor for traitors. Nothing this grants is especially powerful on it's own, but it is a useful for traitors wanting to gain an edge at low cost.

I don't what I'm doing

Massive overhaul to automatic gun functionality, intended primarily to
allow partially-filled magazines to be released.

Now it compiles and doesn't throw runtimes! Also chambering rounds works
right! Unfortunately the contents still need to be looked at, the Russian
Revolver isn't working, and the Bartender's shotgun is just a nightmare.
Also you still can't eject mags.

Mags eject, most gun work. Shotguns still have a problem with reloading
and chambering. Russian Revolver is a bitch.

Heavy finalizing touches. Fixed references to changed trees. Added
icon_states for some magazines. Fixed revolver glitches and subtyped
double-barreled shotguns to revolvers to fix its glitches. Made bullets
and spent shells more obvious via graphical changes. Probably did some
other things but I can't think of what they'd be.

Sprite tweaks for final preparations for pull request.

EXTENT_BUFFER_DUMMY is an awful name for this flag. Buffers which have
this flag set are not in any way dummy. Rather, they are private in the
sense that are not mapped and linked to the global buffer tree. This
flag has subtle implications to the way free_extent_buffer works for
example, as well as controls whether page->mapping->private_lock is held
during extent_buffer release. Pages for an unmapped buffer cannot be
under io, nor can they be written by a 3rd party so taking the lock is
unnecessary.

Add two new callbacks,.setup() and .cleanup(), struct acpi_bus_type
and modify acpi_platform_notify() to call .setup() after executing
acpi_bind_one() successfully and acpi_platform_notify_remove() to
call .cleanup() before running acpi_unbind_one().  This will allow
the users of struct acpi_bus_type, PCI in particular, to specify
operations to be executed right after the given device has been
associated with a companion struct acpi_device and right before
it's going to be detached from that companion, respectively.

The main motivation is to be able to get rid of acpi_pci_bind()
and acpi_pci_unbind(), which are horrible horrible stuff.  [In short,
there are three problems with them: The way they populate the .bind()
and .unbind() callbacks of ACPI devices is rather less than
straightforward, they require special hotplug-specific paths to be
present in the ACPI namespace scanning code and by the time
acpi_pci_unbind() is called the PCI device object in question may
not exist any more.]

We can convert any select-of-constants to math ops:
http://rise4fun.com/Alive/d7d

For this patch, I'm enhancing an existing x86 transform that uses fake multiplies 
(they always become shl/lea) to avoid cmov or branching. The current code misses 
cases where we have a negative constant and a positive constant, so this is just 
trying to plug that hole.

The DAGCombiner diff prevents us from hitting a terrible inefficiency: we can start 
with a select in IR, create a select DAG node, convert it into a sext, convert it 
back into a select, and then lower it to sext machine code.

Some notes about the test diffs:

1. 2010-08-04-MaskedSignedCompare.ll - We were creating control flow that didn't exist in the IR.
2. memcmp.ll - Choose -1 or 1 is the case that got me looking at this again. I 
   think we could avoid the push/pop in some cases if we used 'movzbl %al' instead of an xor on 
   a different reg? That's a post-DAG problem though.
3. mul-constant-result.ll - The trade-off between sbb+not vs. setne+neg could be addressed if 
   that's a regression, but I think those would always be nearly equivalent.
4. pr22338.ll and sext-i1.ll - These tests have undef operands, so I don't think we actually care about these diffs.
5. sbb.ll - This shows a win for what I think is a common case: choose -1 or 0.
6. select.ll - There's another borderline case here: cmp+sbb+or vs. test+set+lea? Also, sbb+not vs. setae+neg shows up again.
7. select_const.ll - These are motivating cases for the enhancement; replace cmov with cheaper ops.

Assembly differences between movzbl and xor to avoid a partial reg stall are caused later by the X86 Fixup SetCC pass.

With the usage of a 32 bit number as a integer, but storing
non-signed values in it, we have cases where numbers greater
than 2 billion are being read in and stored and used before
lower value numbers, which of course is awful and mean.

Recently I came across high fragmentation of vm_map_ram allocator:
vmap_block has free space, but still new blocks continue to appear.
Further investigation showed that certain mapping/unmapping sequences
can exhaust vmalloc space.  On small 32bit systems that's not a big
problem, cause purging will be called soon on a first allocation failure
(alloc_vmap_area), but on 64bit machines, e.g.  x86_64 has 45 bits of
vmalloc space, that can be a disaster.

1) I came up with a simple allocation sequence, which exhausts virtual
   space very quickly:

  while (iters) {

                /* Map/unmap big chunk */
                vaddr = vm_map_ram(pages, 16, -1, PAGE_KERNEL);
                vm_unmap_ram(vaddr, 16);

                /* Map/unmap small chunks.
                 *
                 * -1 for hole, which should be left at the end of each block
                 * to keep it partially used, with some free space available */
                for (i = 0; i < (VMAP_BBMAP_BITS - 16) / 8 - 1; i++) {
                        vaddr = vm_map_ram(pages, 8, -1, PAGE_KERNEL);
                        vm_unmap_ram(vaddr, 8);
                }
  }

The idea behind is simple:

 1. We have to map a big chunk, e.g. 16 pages.

 2. Then we have to occupy the remaining space with smaller chunks, i.e.
    8 pages. At the end small hole should remain to keep block in free list,
    but do not let big chunk to occupy remaining space.

 3. Goto 1 - allocation request of 16 pages can't be completed (only 8 slots
    are left free in the block in the #2 step), new block will be allocated,
    all further requests will lay into newly allocated block.

To have some measurement numbers for all further tests I setup ftrace and
enabled 4 basic calls in a function profile:

        echo vm_map_ram              > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/set_ftrace_filter;
        echo alloc_vmap_area        >> /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/set_ftrace_filter;
        echo vm_unmap_ram           >> /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/set_ftrace_filter;
        echo free_vmap_block        >> /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/set_ftrace_filter;

So for this scenario I got these results:

BEFORE (all new blocks are put to the head of a free list)
# cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace_stat/function0
  Function                               Hit    Time            Avg             s^2

SUMMARY:

The most interesting numbers in those tables are numbers of block
allocations and deallocations: alloc_vmap_area and free_vmap_block
calls, which show that before the change blocks were not freed, and
virtual space and physical memory (vmap_block structure allocations,
etc) were consumed.

Average time which were spent in vm_map_ram/vm_unmap_ram became slightly
better.  That can be explained with a reasonable amount of blocks in a
free list, which we need to iterate to find a suitable free block.

2) Another scenario is a random allocation:

  while (iters) {

                /* Randomly take number from a range [1..32/64] */
                nr = rand(1, VMAP_MAX_ALLOC);
                vaddr = vm_map_ram(pages, nr, -1, PAGE_KERNEL);
                vm_unmap_ram(vaddr, nr);
  }

I chose mersenne twister PRNG to generate persistent random state to
guarantee that both runs have the same random sequence.  For each
vm_map_ram call random number from [1..32/64] was taken to represent
amount of pages which I do map.

I did 10'000 vm_map_ram calls and got these two tables:

SUMMARY:

'BEFORE' table shows, that 420 blocks were allocated and only 37 were
freed.  Remained 383 blocks are still in a free list, consuming virtual
space and physical memory.

'AFTER' table shows, that 414 blocks were allocated and 412 were really
freed.  2 blocks remained in a free list.

So fragmentation was dramatically reduced.  Why? Because when we put
newly allocated block to the head, all further requests will occupy new
block, regardless remained space in other blocks.  In this scenario all
requests come randomly.  Eventually remained free space will be less
than requested size, free list will be iterated and it is possible that
nothing will be found there - finally new block will be created.  So
exhaustion in random scenario happens for the maximum possible
allocation size: 32 pages for 32-bit system and 64 pages for 64-bit
system.

Also average cost of vm_map_ram was reduced from 1.017 us to 0.774 us.
Again this can be explained by iteration through smaller list of free
blocks.

3) Next simple scenario is a sequential allocation, when the allocation
   order is increased for each block.  This scenario forces allocator to
   reach maximum amount of partially free blocks in a free list:

  while (iters) {

                /* Populate free list with blocks with remaining space */
                for (order = 0; order <= ilog2(VMAP_MAX_ALLOC); order++) {
                        nr = VMAP_BBMAP_BITS / (1 << order);

                        /* Leave a hole */
                        nr -= 1;

                        for (i = 0; i < nr; i++) {
                                vaddr = vm_map_ram(pages, (1 << order), -1, PAGE_KERNEL);
                                vm_unmap_ram(vaddr, (1 << order));
                }

                /* Completely occupy blocks from a free list */
                for (order = 0; order <= ilog2(VMAP_MAX_ALLOC); order++) {
                        vaddr = vm_map_ram(pages, (1 << order), -1, PAGE_KERNEL);
                        vm_unmap_ram(vaddr, (1 << order));
                }
  }

Results which I got:

SUMMARY:

No surprises here, almost all numbers are the same.

Fixing this fragmentation problem I also did some improvements in a
allocation logic of a new vmap block: occupy block immediately and get
rid of extra search in a free list.

Also I replaced dirty bitmap with min/max dirty range values to make the
logic simpler and slightly faster, since two longs comparison costs
less, than loop thru bitmap.

This patchset raises several questions:

 Q: Think the problem you comments is already known so that I wrote comments
    about it as ""it could consume lots of address space through fragmentation"".
    Could you tell me about your situation and reason why it should be avoided?
                                                                     Gioh Kim

 A: Indeed, there was a commit 364376383 which adds explicit comment about
    fragmentation.  But fragmentation which is described in this comment caused
    by mixing of long-lived and short-lived objects, when a whole block is pinned
    in memory because some page slots are still in use.  But here I am talking
    about blocks which are free, nobody uses them, and allocator keeps them alive
    forever, continuously allocating new blocks.

 Q: I think that if you put newly allocated block to the tail of a free
    list, below example would results in enormous performance degradation.

    new block: 1MB (256 pages)

    while (iters--) {
      vm_map_ram(3 or something else not dividable for 256) * 85
      vm_unmap_ram(3) * 85
    }

    On every iteration, it needs newly allocated block and it is put to the
    tail of a free list so finding it consumes large amount of time.
                                                                    Joonsoo Kim

 A: Second patch in current patchset gets rid of extra search in a free list,
    so new block will be immediately occupied..

    Also, the scenario above is impossible, cause vm_map_ram allocates virtual
    range in orders, i.e. 2^n.  I.e. passing 3 to vm_map_ram you will allocate
    4 slots in a block and 256 slots (capacity of a block) of course dividable
    on 4, so block will be completely occupied.

    But there is a worst case which we can achieve: each free block has a hole
    equal to order size.

    The maximum size of allocation is 64 pages for 64-bit system
    (if you try to map more, original alloc_vmap_area will be called).

    So the maximum order is 6.  That means that worst case, before allocator
    makes a decision to allocate a new block, is to iterate 7 blocks:

    HEAD
    1st block - has 1  page slot  free (order 0)
    2nd block - has 2  page slots free (order 1)
    3rd block - has 4  page slots free (order 2)
    4th block - has 8  page slots free (order 3)
    5th block - has 16 page slots free (order 4)
    6th block - has 32 page slots free (order 5)
    7th block - has 64 page slots free (order 6)
    TAIL

    So the worst scenario on 64-bit system is that each CPU queue can have 7
    blocks in a free list.

    This can happen only and only if you allocate blocks increasing the order.
    (as I did in the function written in the comment of the first patch)
    This is weird and rare case, but still it is possible.  Afterwards you will
    get 7 blocks in a list.

    All further requests should be placed in a newly allocated block or some
    free slots should be found in a free list.
    Seems it does not look dramatically awful.

This patch (of 3):

If suitable block can't be found, new block is allocated and put into a
head of a free list, so on next iteration this new block will be found
first.

That's bad, because old blocks in a free list will not get a chance to be
fully used, thus fragmentation will grow.

Let's consider this simple example:

 #1 We have one block in a free list which is partially used, and where only
    one page is free:

    HEAD |xxxxxxxxx-| TAIL
                   ^
                   free space for 1 page, order 0

 #2 New allocation request of order 1 (2 pages) comes, new block is allocated
    since we do not have free space to complete this request. New block is put
    into a head of a free list:

    HEAD |----------|xxxxxxxxx-| TAIL

 #3 Two pages were occupied in a new found block:

    HEAD |xx--------|xxxxxxxxx-| TAIL
          ^
          two pages mapped here

 #4 New allocation request of order 0 (1 page) comes.  Block, which was created
    on #2 step, is located at the beginning of a free list, so it will be found
    first:

  HEAD |xxX-------|xxxxxxxxx-| TAIL
          ^                 ^
          page mapped here, but better to use this hole

It is obvious, that it is better to complete request of #4 step using the
old block, where free space is left, because in other case fragmentation
will be highly increased.

But fragmentation is not only the case.  The worst thing is that I can
easily create scenario, when the whole vmalloc space is exhausted by
blocks, which are not used, but already dirty and have several free pages.

Let's consider this function which execution should be pinned to one CPU:

static void exhaust_virtual_space(struct page *pages[16], int iters)
{
        /* Firstly we have to map a big chunk, e.g. 16 pages.
         * Then we have to occupy the remaining space with smaller
         * chunks, i.e. 8 pages. At the end small hole should remain.
         * So at the end of our allocation sequence block looks like
         * this:
         *                XX  big chunk
         * |XXxxxxxxx-|    x  small chunk
         *                 -  hole, which is enough for a small chunk,
         *                    but is not enough for a big chunk
         */
        while (iters--) {
                int i;
                void *vaddr;

                /* Map/unmap big chunk */
                vaddr = vm_map_ram(pages, 16, -1, PAGE_KERNEL);
                vm_unmap_ram(vaddr, 16);

                /* Map/unmap small chunks.
                 *
                 * -1 for hole, which should be left at the end of each block
                 * to keep it partially used, with some free space available */
                for (i = 0; i < (VMAP_BBMAP_BITS - 16) / 8 - 1; i++) {
                        vaddr = vm_map_ram(pages, 8, -1, PAGE_KERNEL);
                        vm_unmap_ram(vaddr, 8);
                }
        }
}

On every iteration new block (1MB of vm area in my case) will be
allocated and then will be occupied, without attempt to resolve small
allocation request using previously allocated blocks in a free list.

In case of random allocation (size should be randomly taken from the
range [1..64] in 64-bit case or [1..32] in 32-bit case) situation is the
same: new blocks continue to appear if maximum possible allocation size
(32 or 64) passed to the allocator, because all remaining blocks in a
free list do not have enough free space to complete this allocation
request.

In summary if new blocks are put into the head of a free list eventually
virtual space will be exhausted.

In current patch I simply put newly allocated block to the tail of a
free list, thus reduce fragmentation, giving a chance to resolve
allocation request using older blocks with possible holes left.

Currently, the ThinkPad-ACPI bay and dock drivers are completely
broken, and cause a NULL pointer derreference in kernel mode (and,
therefore, an OOPS) when they try to issue events (i.e. on dock,
undock, bay ejection, etc).

OTOH, the standard ACPI dock driver can handle the hotplug bays and
docks of the ThinkPads just fine (including batteries) as of 2.6.27.
In fact, it does a much better job of it than thinkpad-acpi ever did.

It is just not worth the hassle to find a way to fix this crap without
breaking the (deprecated) thinkpad-acpi dock/bay ABI.  This is old,
deprecated code that sees little testing or use.

As a quick fix suitable for -stable backports, mark the thinkpad-acpi
bay and dock subdrivers as BROKEN in Kconfig.  The dead code will be
removed by a later patch.

This fixes bugzilla #13669, and should be applied to 2.6.27 and later.

We are pleased to announce ""lightweight userspace priority inheritance"" (PI)
support for futexes.  The following patchset and glibc patch implements it,
ontop of the robust-futexes patchset which is included in 2.6.16-mm1.

We are calling it lightweight for 3 reasons:

 - in the user-space fastpath a PI-enabled futex involves no kernel work
   (or any other PI complexity) at all.  No registration, no extra kernel
   calls - just pure fast atomic ops in userspace.

 - in the slowpath (in the lock-contention case), the system call and
   scheduling pattern is in fact better than that of normal futexes, due to
   the 'integrated' nature of FUTEX_LOCK_PI.  [more about that further down]

 - the in-kernel PI implementation is streamlined around the mutex
   abstraction, with strict rules that keep the implementation relatively
   simple: only a single owner may own a lock (i.e.  no read-write lock
   support), only the owner may unlock a lock, no recursive locking, etc.

  Priority Inheritance - why, oh why???
  -------------------------------------

Many of you heard the horror stories about the evil PI code circling Linux for
years, which makes no real sense at all and is only used by buggy applications
and which has horrible overhead.  Some of you have dreaded this very moment,
when someone actually submits working PI code ;-)

So why would we like to see PI support for futexes?

We'd like to see it done purely for technological reasons.  We dont think it's
a buggy concept, we think it's useful functionality to offer to applications,
which functionality cannot be achieved in other ways.  We also think it's the
right thing to do, and we think we've got the right arguments and the right
numbers to prove that.  We also believe that we can address all the
counter-arguments as well.  For these reasons (and the reasons outlined below)
we are submitting this patch-set for upstream kernel inclusion.

What are the benefits of PI?

  The short reply:
  ----------------

User-space PI helps achieving/improving determinism for user-space
applications.  In the best-case, it can help achieve determinism and
well-bound latencies.  Even in the worst-case, PI will improve the statistical
distribution of locking related application delays.

  The longer reply:
  -----------------

Firstly, sharing locks between multiple tasks is a common programming
technique that often cannot be replaced with lockless algorithms.  As we can
see it in the kernel [which is a quite complex program in itself], lockless
structures are rather the exception than the norm - the current ratio of
lockless vs.  locky code for shared data structures is somewhere between 1:10
and 1:100.  Lockless is hard, and the complexity of lockless algorithms often
endangers to ability to do robust reviews of said code.  I.e.  critical RT
apps often choose lock structures to protect critical data structures, instead
of lockless algorithms.  Furthermore, there are cases (like shared hardware,
or other resource limits) where lockless access is mathematically impossible.

Media players (such as Jack) are an example of reasonable application design
with multiple tasks (with multiple priority levels) sharing short-held locks:
for example, a highprio audio playback thread is combined with medium-prio
construct-audio-data threads and low-prio display-colory-stuff threads.  Add
video and decoding to the mix and we've got even more priority levels.

So once we accept that synchronization objects (locks) are an unavoidable fact
of life, and once we accept that multi-task userspace apps have a very fair
expectation of being able to use locks, we've got to think about how to offer
the option of a deterministic locking implementation to user-space.

Most of the technical counter-arguments against doing priority inheritance
only apply to kernel-space locks.  But user-space locks are different, there
we cannot disable interrupts or make the task non-preemptible in a critical
section, so the 'use spinlocks' argument does not apply (user-space spinlocks
have the same priority inversion problems as other user-space locking
constructs).  Fact is, pretty much the only technique that currently enables
good determinism for userspace locks (such as futex-based pthread mutexes) is
priority inheritance:

Currently (without PI), if a high-prio and a low-prio task shares a lock [this
is a quite common scenario for most non-trivial RT applications], even if all
critical sections are coded carefully to be deterministic (i.e.  all critical
sections are short in duration and only execute a limited number of
instructions), the kernel cannot guarantee any deterministic execution of the
high-prio task: any medium-priority task could preempt the low-prio task while
it holds the shared lock and executes the critical section, and could delay it
indefinitely.

  Implementation:
  ---------------

As mentioned before, the userspace fastpath of PI-enabled pthread mutexes
involves no kernel work at all - they behave quite similarly to normal
futex-based locks: a 0 value means unlocked, and a value==TID means locked.
(This is the same method as used by list-based robust futexes.) Userspace uses
atomic ops to lock/unlock these mutexes without entering the kernel.

To handle the slowpath, we have added two new futex ops:

  FUTEX_LOCK_PI
  FUTEX_UNLOCK_PI

If the lock-acquire fastpath fails, [i.e.  an atomic transition from 0 to TID
fails], then FUTEX_LOCK_PI is called.  The kernel does all the remaining work:
if there is no futex-queue attached to the futex address yet then the code
looks up the task that owns the futex [it has put its own TID into the futex
value], and attaches a 'PI state' structure to the futex-queue.  The pi_state
includes an rt-mutex, which is a PI-aware, kernel-based synchronization
object.  The 'other' task is made the owner of the rt-mutex, and the
FUTEX_WAITERS bit is atomically set in the futex value.  Then this task tries
to lock the rt-mutex, on which it blocks.  Once it returns, it has the mutex
acquired, and it sets the futex value to its own TID and returns.  Userspace
has no other work to perform - it now owns the lock, and futex value contains
FUTEX_WAITERS|TID.

If the unlock side fastpath succeeds, [i.e.  userspace manages to do a TID ->
0 atomic transition of the futex value], then no kernel work is triggered.

If the unlock fastpath fails (because the FUTEX_WAITERS bit is set), then
FUTEX_UNLOCK_PI is called, and the kernel unlocks the futex on the behalf of
userspace - and it also unlocks the attached pi_state->rt_mutex and thus wakes
up any potential waiters.

Note that under this approach, contrary to other PI-futex approaches, there is
no prior 'registration' of a PI-futex.  [which is not quite possible anyway,
due to existing ABI properties of pthread mutexes.]

Also, under this scheme, 'robustness' and 'PI' are two orthogonal properties
of futexes, and all four combinations are possible: futex, robust-futex,
PI-futex, robust+PI-futex.

  glibc support:
  --------------

Ulrich Drepper and Jakub Jelinek have written glibc support for PI-futexes
(and robust futexes), enabling robust and PI (PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT) POSIX
mutexes.  (PTHREAD_PRIO_PROTECT support will be added later on too, no
additional kernel changes are needed for that).  [NOTE: The glibc patch is
obviously inofficial and unsupported without matching upstream kernel
functionality.]

the patch-queue and the glibc patch can also be downloaded from:

  http://redhat.com/~mingo/PI-futex-patches/

Rostedt, Esben Nielsen, Benedikt Spranger, Daniel Walker, John Cooper, Arjan
van de Ven, Oleg Nesterov and others.  Credits for related prior projects goes
to Dirk Grambow, Inaky Perez-Gonzalez, Bill Huey and many others.

Clean up the futex code, before adding more features to it:

 - use u32 as the futex field type - that's the ABI

Because of the terrible structuring of scsi-bidi-commands
it breaks some of the life time rules of a scsi-command.
It is now not allowed to free up the block-request before
cleanup and partial deallocation of the scsi-command. (Which
is not so for none bidi commands)

The right fix to this problem would be to make bidi command
a first citizen by allocating a scsi_sdb pointer at scsi command
just like cmd->prot_sdb. The bidi sdb should be allocated/deallocated
as part of the get/put_command (Again like the prot_sdb) and the
current decoupling of scsi_cmnd and blk-request should be kept.

For now make sure scsi_release_buffers() is called before the
call to blk_end_request_all() which might cause the suicide of
the block requests. At best the leak of bidi buffers, at worse
a crash, as there is a race between the existence of the bidi_request
and the free of the associated bidi_sdb.

The reason this was never hit before is because only OSD has the potential
of doing asynchronous bidi commands. (So does bsg but it is never used)
And OSD clients just happen to do all their bidi commands synchronously, up
until recently.

patterns.

This is causing Clang to miscompile itself for 32-bit x86 somehow, and likely
also on ARM and PPC. I really don't know how, but reverting now that I've
confirmed this is actually the culprit. I have a reproduction as well and so
should be able to restore this shortly.

This reverts commit r223764.

Original commit log follows:
Teach instcombine to canonicalize ""element extraction"" from a load of an
integer and ""element insertion"" into a store of an integer into actual
element extraction, element insertion, and vector loads and stores.

Previously various parts of LLVM (including instcombine itself) would
introduce integer loads and stores into the code as a way of opaquely
loading and storing ""bits"". In some cases (such as a memcpy of
std::complex<float> object) we will eventually end up using those bits
in non-integer types. In order for SROA to effectively promote the
allocas involved, it splits these ""store a bag of bits"" integer loads
and stores up into the constituent parts. However, for non-alloca loads
and tsores which remain, it uses integer math to recombine the values
into a large integer to load or store.

All of this would be ""fine"", except that it forces LLVM to go through
integer math to combine and split up values. While this makes perfect
sense for integers (and in fact is critical for bitfields to end up
lowering efficiently) it is *terrible* for non-integer types, especially
floating point types. We have a much more canonical way of representing
the act of concatenating the bits of two SSA values in LLVM: a vector
and insertelement. This patch teaching InstCombine to use this
representation.

With this patch applied, LLVM will no longer introduce integer math into
the critical path of every loop over std::complex<float> operations such
as those that make up the hot path of ... oh, most HPC code, Eigen, and
any other heavy linear algebra library.

For the record, I looked *extensively* at fixing this in other parts of
the compiler, but it just doesn't work:
- We really do want to canonicalize memcpy and other bit-motion to
  integer loads and stores. SSA values are tremendously more powerful
  than ""copy"" intrinsics. Not doing this regresses massive amounts of
  LLVM's scalar optimizer.
- We really do need to split up integer loads and stores of this form in
  SROA or every memcpy of a trivially copyable struct will prevent SSA
  formation of the members of that struct. It essentially turns off
  SROA.
- The closest alternative is to actually split the loads and stores when
  partitioning with SROA, but this has all of the downsides historically
  discussed of splitting up loads and stores -- the wide-store
  information is fundamentally lost. We would also see performance
  regressions for bitfield-heavy code and other places where the
  integers aren't really intended to be split without seemingly
  arbitrary logic to treat integers totally differently.
- We *can* effectively fix this in instcombine, so it isn't that hard of
  a choice to make IMO.

Vikram reported that his ARM64 compiler managed to 'optimize' away the
preempt_count manipulations in code like:

	preempt_enable_no_resched();
	put_user();
	preempt_disable();

Irrespective of that fact that that is horrible code that should be
fixed for many reasons, it does highlight a deficiency in the generic
preempt_count manipulators. As it is never right to combine/elide
preempt_count manipulations like this.

Therefore sprinkle some volatile in the two generic accessors to
ensure the compiler is aware of the fact that the preempt_count is
observed outside of the regular program-order view and thus cannot be
optimized away like this.

x86; the only arch not using the generic code is not affected as we
do all this in asm in order to use the segment base per-cpu stuff.

Since commit d8a93dafa316d, tags have an ""index"" property which decides about
the order in which they are displayed in the taglist. If a tag doesn't have this
property set, the next call to awful.tag.gettags() will fix this and ""invent"" an
index for this new tag.

However, if multiple tags didn't have an ""index"" property, gettags() would
assign all of them the same index. The following call to table.sort() would then
do random magic to these tags (remember: table.sort() is not a stable sorting
algorithm, so it is allowed to randomly swap around entries which have the same
sorting key).

Fix this by making sure that the new ""index"" properties are different from each
other.

This is one part of many of a locale refactor. See
http://reviews.llvm.org/D17146 for an idea of where this is going.

For the locale refactor, the locale management functions (newlocale,
freelocale, uselocale) are needed in a separate header from the various _l
functions. This is because some platforms implement the _l functions in terms
of a locale switcher RAII helper, and the locale switcher RAII helper needs
the locale management functions. This patch helps pave the way by getting all
the functions in the right files, so that later diffs aren't completely
horrible.

The ""do-nothing"" / ""nop"" locale functions are also useful on their own for
other lightweight platforms. Putting these nop implementations in
support/xlocale should enable code sharing.

Unfortunately, I have no access to a newlib system to build and test with, so
this change has been made blind.

When handling knockout groups, we have to copy the background from the
previous group in so we can 'knockout' properly. If the previous group
is a different colorspace, this gives us problems!

The fix, implemented here, is to update the copy_pixmap_rect function
to know how to copy between pixmaps of different depth.

Gray <-> RGB are the ones we really care about; the generic code will
probably do a horrible job, but shouldn't ever be called at present.

This suffices to stop the crashing - we will probably revisit this
when we revise the blending support.

This fixes a long standing tag history breakage. To store history
of tag switching we rely on a special signal ""tag::history::update""
which needs to be emitted by any function which deals with tag
selection.

History is multi-level with a configurable limit:
awful.tag.history.limit = 20 (by default).

awful.tag.history.restore function gets a new argument 'idx' which can
be either 'previous' (default) which will revert to the previously
selected set of tags, or a numerical index in the tag history table.

Any awful.titlebar.widget.button widget (e.g. floatingbutton or closebutton)
decides on the currently visible symbol based on several factors. One of them is
""is the client currently focused?"" and thus the button has to be updated when
the client is focused/unfocused.

The way the code did this was to use client.connect_signal(""focus"", f) and
client.connect_signal(""unfocus"", f). However, these signals are never
disconnected and kept alive forever. The callback function had a strong
reference to the client (as an upvalue) and thus this also prevented the client
from being garbage collected.

Fix this by using c:connect_signal(""focus/unfocis"", f) instead. These kind of
signals are only kept alive by the client object and don't prevent it from being
garbage collected.

This fixes the new test that the previous commit added.

The patch below moves the cpu hotplugging higher up in the cpufreq
layering; this is needed to avoid recursive taking of the cpu hotplug
lock and to otherwise detangle the mess.

The new rules are:
1. you must do lock_cpu_hotplug() around the following functions:
   __cpufreq_driver_target
   __cpufreq_governor (for CPUFREQ_GOV_LIMITS operation only)
   __cpufreq_set_policy
2. governer methods (.governer) must NOT take the lock_cpu_hotplug()
   lock in any way; they are called with the lock taken already
3. if your governer spawns a thread that does things, like calling
   __cpufreq_driver_target, your thread must honor rule #1.
4. the policy lock and other cpufreq internal locks nest within
   the lock_cpu_hotplug() lock.

I'm not entirely happy about how the __cpufreq_governor rule ended up
(conditional locking rule depending on the argument) but basically all
callers pass this as a constant so it's not too horrible.

The patch also removes the cpufreq_governor() function since during the
locking audit it turned out to be entirely unused (so no need to fix it)

The patch works on my testbox, but it could use more testing
(otoh... it can't be much worse than the current code)

Seems that nobody cares and perhaps the recent klibc permission changes

Summary:
The goal is to provide a fast path for watchman to flesh
out the total set of changed files when it needs relay that information
on to consumers.

We choose not to include the full list in the Journal when checking out
between revisions because it will not always be needed and may be an
expensive `O(repo)` operation to compute.  This means that watchman
needs to expand that information for itself, and that is currently
a fairly slow query to invoke through mercurial.

Since watchman is responding to journal events from eden we know that
we have tree data for the old and new hashes and thus we should be
able to efficiently compute that diff.

This implementation is slightly awful because it will instantiate an
unlinked TreeInode object for one side of the query, and will in
turn populate any children that differ as it walks down the tree.
A follow on diff will look at making a flavor of the diff code that
can diff raw Tree objects instead.

Sometimes merge attempts fail with no user-visible message. Sometimes
there is an error in the logs, but sometimes it is never logged, or
the error does not provide enough context. Add lots of debug logging
to help administrators and Gerrit developers track down bugs.

It is possible that eventually some of these informational conditions
will make it into end-user-visible messages, but for now just log
until we get a better sense of what are common failures and how we
might communicate them.

Include in each log message an identifier for the current operation,
which includes a project, branch, and timestamp. This is because
multiple merge runs can run simultaneously in the work queue, and the
logger instance is (and probably should remain) static.

Limit somewhat the available method signatures in the newly added
helper methods, to avoid the terrible ambiguity between
Logger#error(String, Throwable) and Logger#error(String, Object...).

Summary:
The default monospace font has a really low x-height which made inline <code>
elements look pretty terrible, especially in headings. I tried out a few
different alternatives and Roboto Mono looks the best to me.

<code> blocks had padding/letter spacing that made them look even weirder
inline. I just pulled these. I don't think the code blocks suffer.

We weren't actually using TypeKit since it was never configured for our domain.
I pulled it out and replaced it with ""Helvetica Neue"", Helvetica, Arial,
sans-serif.

Subpixel smoothing looks bad on body text, but looks pretty great on code IMO.

implicitly using in-context variables they shouldn't have been.  My best guess
is through `assumption`, but I'm not sure.  Transitively, `equal_1` and
`equal_2` used these, and so had extra arguments, causing the error message.  I
solved this by adding `clear` to the starts of those functions that were
accidentally picking up extra variables, but it might be a sign that being more
parsimonious with the section-level variables would be a good idea.

The fact that the error message was that egregiously terrible, however, is a Coq
bug and should be reported.

Similar to the libvirt.pot, .po files contain line numbers and file
names identifying where in the source a translatable string comes from.
The source locations in the .po files are thrown away and replaced with
content from the libvirt.pot whenever msgmerge is run, so this is not
precious information that needs to be stored in git.

When msgmerge processes a .po file, it will add in any msgids from the
libvirt.pot that were not already present. Thus, if a particular msgid
currently has no translation, it can be considered redundant and again
does not need storing in git.

When msgmerge processes a .po file and can't find an exact existing
translation match, it will try todo fuzzy matching instead, marking such
entries with a ""# fuzzy"" comment to alert the translator to take a
look and either discard, edit or accept the match. Looking at the
existing fuzzy matches in .po files shows that the quality is awful,
with many having a completely different set of printf format specifiers
between the msgid and fuzzy msgstr entry. Fortunately when msgfmt
generates the .gmo, the fuzzy entries are all ignored anyway. The fuzzy
entries could be useful to translators if they were working on the .po
files directly from git, but Libvirt outsourced translation to the
Fedora Zanata system, so keeping fuzzy matches in git is not much help.

Finally, by default msgids are sorted based on source location. Thus, if
a bit of code with translatable text is moved from one file to another,
it may shift around in the .po file, despite the msgid not itself changing.
If the msgids were sorted alphabetically, the .po files would have
stable ordering when code is refactored.

This patch takes advantage of the above observations to canonicalize
and minimize the content stored for .po files in git. Instead of storing
the real .po files, we now store .mini.po files.

The .mini.po files are the same file format as .po files, but have no
source location comments, are sorted alphabetically, and all fuzzy
msgstrs and msgids with no translation are discarded. This cuts the size
of content in the po directory from 109MB to 19MB.

Users working from a libvirt git checkout who need the full .po files
can run ""make update-po"", which merges the libvirt.pot and .mini.po
file to create a .po file containing all the content previously stored
in git.

Conversely if a full .po file has been modified, for example, by
downloading new content from Zanata, the .mini.po files can be updated
by running ""make update-mini-po"". The resulting diffs of the .mini.po
file will clearly show the changed translations without any of the noise
that previously obscured content. Being able to see content changes
clearly actually identified a bug in the zanata python client where it
was adding bogus ""fuzzy"" annotations to many messages:

  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1564497

Users working from libvirt releases should not see any difference in
behaviour, since the tarballs only contain the full .po files, not the
.mini.po files.

As an added benefit, generating tarballs with ""make dist"", will no
longer cause creation of dirty files in git, since it won't touch the
.mini.po files, only the .po files which are no longer kept in git.

To avoid creating a single commit 100+MB in size, each language is
minimized separately in a following commit.

This extracts the code for finding the next screen
from focus_bydirection to a separate method on
the screen object.

The main reason was to use the finding code without
actually changing the screen focus but this should
incidentally make the code slightly easier to test
as well since both concerns can be tested in
isolation.

This makes Function derive from Annotation now because it is the only core LLVM
class that still has an annotation stuck onto it: MachineFunction.
MachineFunction is obviously horrible and gross (like most other annotations), but
will be the subject of refactorings later in the future.  Besides many fewer
Function objects are dynamically allocated that instructions blocks, constants,

Commit 74c2107759d (serial: Use block_til_ready helper) and its fixup
3f582b8c110 (serial: fix termios settings in open) introduced a
regression on UV systems. The serial eventually freezes while being
used. It's completely unpredictable and sometimes needs a heap of
traffic to happen first.

To reproduce this, yast installation was used as it turned out to be
pretty reliable in reproducing. Especially during installation process
where one doesn't have an SSH daemon running. And no monitor as the HW
is completely headless. So this was fun to find. Given the machine
doesn't boot on vanilla before 2.6.36 final. (And the commits above
are older.)

Unless there is some bad race in the code, the hardware seems to be
pretty broken. Otherwise pure MSR read should not cause such a bug,
or?

So to prevent the bug, revert to the old behavior. I.e. read modem
status only if we really have to -- for non-CLOCAL set serials.
Non-CLOCAL works on this hardware OK, I tried. See? I don't.

And document that shit.

A new accessor for gic_write_bpr1 is added to arch_gicv3.h in 4.9,
whilst the CP15 accessors are redifined in a separate branch.
This leads to a horrible clash, where the new accessor ends up with
a crap ""asm volatile"" definition.

Work around this by carrying our own definition of gic_write_bpr1,
creating a small conflict which will be obvious to resolve.

Make sure we never close fds before we drop their related event-source.
This will cause horrible disruptions if the fd-num is re-used by someone
else. Under normal conditions, this should not cause any problems as the
close() will drop the fd from the epoll-set automatically. However, this
changes if you have any child processes with a copy of that fd.

This fixes issue #163.

Background:
        If you create an epoll-set via epoll_create() (lets call it 'EFD')
        you can add file-descriptors to it to watch for events. Whenever
        you call EPOLL_CTL_ADD on a file-descriptor you want to watch, the
        kernel looks up the attached ""struct file"" pointer, that this FD
        refers to. This combination of the FD-number and the ""struct file""
        pointer is used as key to link it into the epoll-set (EFD).

        This means, if you duplicate your file-descriptor, you can watch
        this file-descriptor, too (because the duplicate will have a
        different FD-number, hence, the combination of FD-number and
        ""struct file"" is different as before).

        If you want to stop watching an FD, you use EPOLL_CTL_DEL and pass
        the FD to the kernel. The kernel again looks up your
        file-descriptor in your FD-table to find the linked ""struct file"".
        This FD-number and ""struct file"" combination is then dropped from
        the epoll-set (EFD).

        Last, but not least: If you close a file-descriptor that is linked
        to an epoll-set, the kernel does *NOTHING* regarding the
        epoll-set. This is a vital observation! Because this means, your
        epoll_wait() calls will still return the metadata you used to
        watch/subscribe your file-descriptor to events.
        There is one exception to this rule: If the file-descriptor that
        you just close()ed was the last FD that referred to the underlying
        ""struct file"", then _all_ epoll-set watches/subscriptions are
        destroyed. Hence, if you never dup()ed your FD, then a simple
        close() will also unsubscribe it from any epoll-set.

        With this in mind, lets look at fork():
                Assume you have an epoll-set (EFD) and a bunch of FDs
                subscribed to events on that EFD. If you now call fork(),
                the new process gets a copy of your file-descriptor table.
                This means, the whole table is copied and the ""struct
                file"" reference of each FD is increased by 1. It is
                important to notice that the FD-numbers in the child are
                exactly the same as in the parent (eg., FD #5 in the child
                refers to the same ""struct file"" as FD #5 in the parent).

                This means, if the child calls EPOLL_CTL_DEL on an FD, the
                kernel will look up the linked ""struct file"" and drop the
                FD-number and ""struct file"" combination from the epoll-set
                (EFD). However, this will effectively drop the
                subscription that was installed by the parent.

                To sum up: even though the child gets a duplicate of the
                EFD and all FDs, the subscriptions in the EFD are *NOT*
                duplicated!

Now, with this in mind, lets look at what udevd does:
        Udevd has a bunch of file-descriptors that it watches in its
        sd-event main-loop. Whenever a uevent is received, the event is
        dispatched on its workers. If no suitable worker is present, a new
        worker is fork()ed to handle the event. Inside of this worker, we
        try to free all resources we inherited. However, the fork() call
        is done from a call-stack that is never rewinded. Therefore, this
        call stack might own references that it drops once it is left.
        Those references we cannot deduce from the fork()'ed process;
        effectively causing us to leak objects in the worker (eg., the
        call to sd_event_dispatch() that dispatched our uevent owns a
        reference to the sd_event object it used; and drops it again once
        the function is left).

        (Another example is udev_monitor_ref() for each 'worker' that is
         also inherited by all children; thus keeping the udev-monitor and
         the uevent-fd alive in all children (which is the real cause for
         bug #163))

        (The extreme variant is sd_event_source_unref(), which explicitly
         keeps event-sources alive, if they're currently dispatched,
         knowing that the dispatcher will free the event once done. But
         if the dispatcher is in the parent, the child will never ever
         free that object, thus leaking it)

        This is usually not an issue. However, if such an object has a
        file-descriptor embedded, this FD is left open and never closed in
        the child.

In manager_exit(), if we now destroy an object (i.e., close its embedded
file-descriptor) before we destroy its related sd_event_source, then
sd-event will not be able to drop the FD from the epoll-set (EFD). This
is, because the FD is no longer valid at the time we call EPOLL_CTL_DEL.
Hence, the kernel cannot figure out the linked ""struct file"" and thus
cannot remove the FD-number plus ""struct file"" combination; effectively
leaving the subscription in the epoll-set.
Since we leak the uevent-fd in the children, they retain a copy of the FD
pointing to the same ""struct file"". Thus, the EFD-subscription are not
automatically removed by close() (as described above). Therefore, the main
daemon will still get its metadata back on epoll_watch() whenever an event
occurs (even though it already freed the metadata). This then causes the
free-after-use bug described in #163.

This patch fixes the order in which we destruct objects and related
sd-event-sources. Some open questions remain:

 * Why does source_io_unregister() not warn on EPOLL_CTL_DEL failures?
   This really needs to be turned into an assert_return().

 * udevd really should not leak file-descriptors into its children. Fixing
   this would *not* have prevented this bug, though (since the child-setup
   is still async).
   It's non-trivial to fix this, though. The stack-context of the caller
   cannot be rewinded, so we cannot figure out temporary refs. Maybe it's
   time to exec() the udev-workers?

 * Why does the kernel not copy FD-subscriptions across fork()?
   Or at least drop subscriptions if you close() your FD (it uses the
   FD-number as key, so it better subscribe to it)?
   Or it better used
         FD+""struct file_table*""+""struct file*""
   as key to not allow the childen to share the subscription table..
   *sigh*
   Seems like we have to live with that API forever.

For some reason or other, `xmlsec` wound up being installed in the
home directory of the user invoking the installer. This is probably
related to the horrible hacks Debian and Ubuntu apply to Python's
`distutils`.

Instead, we use `pip` and pass it the Debian-specific `--system`

Tidied the supplypacks up for consistant names and to avoid The Bureaucracy crate etc.

Created an Innate Communication verb thats given to the cultists when converted and removed when deconverted.
It possibly works with constructs but cant really test because the make constructs procs are all kinds of messed up.
Anyway - they'll tear at their arms, smear blood on the floor, and communicate as normal per the rune. Its pretty rudimentry right now and could be improved in a few ways - see the comments.

Added a link to open the Read Tome window on the Notes page as apparently alert() is limited to a whopping three choices.

Added a built in communication system for the tomes, it works pretty much like the current communicate rune.

Fixed a load of fucked up tabbing in ritual.dm, I don't know who to blame but I'm betting it was sadbutt.

Adds the electroadaptive pseudocircuit - technobabbly name intended - to engineering cyborgs. They can use this in place of circuit boards during construction of alarms, APCs, and firelocks to create a circuit at the cost of varying amounts of power. There's a brief cooldown between uses to prevent borgs from becoming circuit farms on wheels.

Note that in order to create circuits, you need to cannibalize simple circuits (anything the pseudocircuit can make) to get the material. Each pseudocircuit starts with five circuits by default.

It can also be used on a completed APC frame with no power cell to create an empty, low-capacity power cell in the APC at the cost of 500W of power; this is to allow borgs to repair a broken APC without external aid because the CE won't bring the fucking cell over get over here you brainless fuck.

Code-wise, this just adds extra checks to the frames' attackby procs that do the same thing as the other circuits. Airlock electronics, computer boards, and machine circuits cannot be made using this, and it's only for basic construction purposes.",,1,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,8,8,0,0,3525,ab88e1d6ed57fe58256a34f13551ef155ee1eb36,2017-09-17 22:32:13 UTC,FALSE

Doing writeback on lots of little files causes terrible IOPS storms
because of the per-mapping writeback plugging we do. This
essentially causes imeediate dispatch of IO for each mapping,
regardless of the context in which writeback is occurring.

IOWs, running a concurrent write-lots-of-small 4k files using fsmark
on XFS results in a huge number of IOPS being issued for data
writes.  Metadata writes are sorted and plugged at a high level by
XFS, so aggregate nicely into large IOs. However, data writeback IOs
are dispatched in individual 4k IOs, even when the blocks of two
consecutively written files are adjacent.

Test VM: 8p, 8GB RAM, 4xSSD in RAID0, 100TB sparse XFS filesystem,
metadata CRCs enabled.

Kernel: 3.10-rc5 + xfsdev + my 3.11 xfs queue (~70 patches)

Test:

$ ./fs_mark  -D  10000  -S0  -n  10000  -s  4096  -L  120  -d
/mnt/scratch/0  -d  /mnt/scratch/1  -d  /mnt/scratch/2  -d
/mnt/scratch/3  -d  /mnt/scratch/4  -d  /mnt/scratch/5  -d
/mnt/scratch/6  -d  /mnt/scratch/7

Result:

		wall	sys	create rate	Physical write IO
		time	CPU	(avg files/s)	 IOPS	Bandwidth
		-----	-----	------------	------	---------
unpatched	6m56s	15m47s	24,000+/-500	26,000	130MB/s
patched		5m06s	13m28s	32,800+/-600	 1,500	180MB/s
improvement	-26.44%	-14.68%	  +36.67%	-94.23%	+38.46%

If I use zero length files, this workload at about 500 IOPS, so
plugging drops the data IOs from roughly 25,500/s to 1000/s.
3 lines of code, 35% better throughput for 15% less CPU.

The benefits of plugging at this layer are likely to be higher for
spinning media as the IO patterns for this workload are going make a
much bigger difference on high IO latency devices.....

_Swap() is defined in nano_internal.h.  Everything calls _Swap().
Pretty much nothing that called _Swap() included nano_internal.h,
expecting it to be picked up automatically through other headers (as
it happened, from the kernel arch-specific include file).  A new
_Swap() is going to need some other symbols in the inline definition,
so I needed to break that cycle.  Now nothing sees _Swap() defined
anymore.  Put nano_internal.h everywhere it's needed.

Our kernel includes remain a big awful yucky mess.  This makes things
more correct but no less ugly.  Needs cleanup.

Summary:
This comes with `Implicit Conversion Sanitizer - integer sign change` (D50250):
```
signed char test(unsigned int x) { return x; }
```
`clang++ -fsanitize=implicit-conversion -S -emit-llvm -o - /tmp/test.cpp -O3`
* Old: {F6904292}
* With this patch: {F6904294}

General pattern:
  X & Y

Where `Y` is checking that all the high bits (covered by a mask `4294967168`)
are uniform, i.e.  `%arg & 4294967168`  can be either  `4294967168`  or  `0`
Pattern can be one of:
  %t = add        i32 %arg,    128
  %r = icmp   ult i32 %t,      256
Or
  %t0 = shl       i32 %arg,    24
  %t1 = ashr      i32 %t0,     24
  %r  = icmp  eq  i32 %t1,     %arg
Or
  %t0 = trunc     i32 %arg  to i8
  %t1 = sext      i8  %t0   to i32
  %r  = icmp  eq  i32 %t1,     %arg
This pattern is a signed truncation check.

And `X` is checking that some bit in that same mask is zero.
I.e. can be one of:
  %r = icmp sgt i32   %arg,    -1
Or
  %t = and      i32   %arg,    2147483648
  %r = icmp eq  i32   %t,      0

Since we are checking that all the bits in that mask are the same,
and a particular bit is zero, what we are really checking is that all the
masked bits are zero.
So this should be transformed to:
  %r = icmp ult i32 %arg, 128

The transform itself ended up being rather horrible, even though i omitted some cases.
Surely there is some infrastructure that can help clean this up that i missed?

The initial commit (rL339610)
was reverted, since the first assert was being triggered.
The @positive_with_extra_and test now has coverage for that case.

Normally, a blank CharField is saved as '', which means two blank
CharFields will violate a unique=True constraint. Instead, we need
CharFields to be nullable, because two null fields do NOT violate this
constraint.

This was an awful lot of mucking around in the guts of metaprogramming
for something that turned out to be a straightforward fix via an
option that was totally documented, but not apparently wreathed in the
neon snakes I required.

About The Pull Request

So based on feedback I've been getting over the past month, the main issue with medical kiosks is that even as a roundstart, public medical analyzer, the cost on use at T1 isn't anywhere near helpful enough to warrant not breaking into medical storage and printing an analyzer. This go around I'm pretty much scrapping the dependence on upgrades in order to turn it into an economy reliant machine instead.


Now featuring so much info with all 4 scans, I had to put them into tabs!

Now, the machine begins with the full docket of information typically provided by the Advanced Medical Analyzer, but each section of information is an individual purchase. General Information is provided under ""Patient Health"", Issues where the player may realize something non-obvious is wrong can be found under ""Symptom Based Checkup"", and ""Neuro/Radiological Scan"" covers the host of Cellular/Radiation issues.

As a means of alleviating concerns about having the whole host of advanced medical scanner information available round-start, I've bumped up the minimum cost for each scan type to 10 credits, so for the whole set of information it'll cost you about 40 credits.

Quick video link showing how it works in practice:
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/184507411648741378/642437277632561182/2019-11-08_13-49-31.mp4

In addition to that, some sanity checks that were missing from the first couple PRs were added, so Ghosts and Borgs won't runtime trying to use a machine that only works on the living.

Bugfixes from the first time (I am so sorry about the line spacing)
Have a working, functional TGUI that shows all the old Kiosk information plus what you can get off of medical analyzers that I skipped over

And these things if/when I get to it:

Adds emagged functionality.

    Allow for crew to scan other crew using the machine.

In the meantime this is SUPER DNM until at least those first 3 are ironed out.
Why It's Good For The Game

Helps to Enforce the Medical Kiosk as what I initially hoped it would function as, a money sink for Medbay. With the new budget changes, this means that crew who use the medical kiosk are actively paying every member of medbay.

Additionally, the feedback I got from literally everyone I've talked to has been pretty universal: The medical kiosk is pretty much worthless to use, even at shift start, because it's not worth upgrading and by the time you DO upgrade it, you can just print your own medical analyzer and skip the whole process.
Changelog

cl
add: Medical Kiosks now have more functionality available, including showing blood levels, virus information, and cumulative total health.
add: You now now alt-click a Medical Kiosk to remove a medical scanner wand, so that you can scan someone else.
add: Medical Kiosks now use TGUI-next.
tweak: Now, the information in the medical kiosk is split up between 4 different scan types, General, Symptom based, Neuro/Radiologic, and Chemical Analysis scans.
balance: Each medical kiosk scan costs a base 10 credits minimum.
fix: Medical Kiosks don't runtime on ghosts and borgs anymore.

O_TEXT is the default mode for fctrl's open() and on windows created
files, line endings are counted by fstat() as CR+LF adding an extra
byte for each line. the result from this is that, while the file still
can be read into a buffer, the read() return (ret) has a different
size compared to the previously allocated buffer, breaking at:

	if (ret == mem->size)

a solution is to open() the file in O_BINARY mode, which should
technically suppress the EOL translation.

Summary:
The reason libc++ implemented a throwing debug mode handler was for ease of testing. Specifically,
I thought that if a debug violation aborted, we could only test one violation per file. This made
it impossible to test debug mode. Which throwing behavior we could test more!

However, the throwing approach didn't work either, since there are debug violations underneath noexcept
functions. This lead to the introduction of `_NOEXCEPT_DEBUG`, which was only noexcept when debug
mode was off.

Having thought more and having grown wiser, `_NOEXCEPT_DEBUG` was a horrible decision. It was
viral, it didn't cover all the cases it needed to, and it was observable to the user -- at worst
changing the behavior of their program.

  This patch removes the throwing debug handler, and rewrites the debug tests using 'fork-ing' style
  death tests.

Don't use printk() where ""current_thread_info()"" is crap.

Until when we switch to running on init_stack, current_thread_info() evaluates
to crap. Printk uses ""current"" at times (in detail, &current is evaluated with
CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK to check the spinlock owner task).

And this leads to random segmentation faults.

Exactly, what happens is that &current = *(current_thread_info()), i.e. round
down $esp and dereference the value. I.e. access the stack below $esp, which
causes SIGSEGV on a VM_GROWSDOWN vma (see arch/i386/mm/fault.c).

This will provide the analogous replacements for the PassManagerBuilder
and other code long term. This code is extracted from the opt tool
currently, and I plan to extend it as I build up support for using the
new pass manager in Clang and other places.

Mailing this out for review in part to let folks comment on the terrible names
here. A brief word about why I chose the names I did.

The library is called ""Passes"" to try and make it clear that it is a high-level
utility and where *all* of the passes come together and are registered in
a common library. I didn't want it to be *limited* to a registry though, the
registry is just one component.

The class is a ""PassBuilder"" but this name I'm less happy with. It doesn't
build passes in any traditional sense and isn't a Builder-style API at all. The
class is a PassRegisterer or PassAdder, but neither of those really make a lot
of sense. This class is responsible for constructing passes for registry in an
analysis manager or for population of a pass pipeline. If anyone has a better
name, I would love to hear it. The other candidate I looked at was
PassRegistrar, but that doesn't really fit either. There is no register of all
the passes in use, and so I think continuing the ""registry"" analog outside of
the registry of pass *names* and *types* is a mistake. The objects themselves
are just objects with the new pass manager.

The dispc error handler tries to ""fix"" issues by disabling and enabling
panel. This is problematic, as we're trying to remove the dependency
from omapdss to the omap_dss_devices. It's also racy, and doesn't really
fix anything.

This patch removes the use of omap_dss_device from the error handler,
and just disables and enables the associated overlay manager. This
should produce similar results as the previous solution, without using
dssdev.

However, the error handling is still horrible. But the problem boils
down to one question, to which I don't have a clear answer: what to do
when a HW error happens?

a) hisax_init_pcmcia() needs to be defined only if we have
   CONFIG_HOTPLUG (no PCMCIA support otherwise) and can be declared
   __devinit.

b) HiSax_inithardware() can go __init

c) hisax_register() is passing to checkcard() full-blown hisax_cs_setup_card():
	checkcard(i, id, NULL, hisax_d_if->owner, hisax_cs_setup_card);
   The problem with it is that
	* hisax_cs_setup_card() is __devinit
	* hisax_register() is not
	* hisax_cs_setup_card() is a switch from hell, calling a lot of
	  setup_some_weirdcard() depending on card->typ.  _These_ are also
	  __devinit.

   However, in hisax_register() we have card->typ equal to
   ISDN_CTYPE_DYNAMIC, which reduces hisax_cs_setup_card() to ""nevermind
   all that crap, just do nothing and return 2"".  So we add a
   trimmed-down callback doing just that and passed to checkcard() by
   hisax_register().  _This_ is non-init (we can stand the impact on
   .text size).

Voila - no section warnings from drivers/isdn

Before we render a page we need to evaluate whether we need
transparency or not. To establish this, we recursively walk the
resources looking for certain markers (blend modes, alpha levels,
smasks etc). To avoid doing this repeatedly we'd like to stash
the results somewhere.

Currently we write a '.useBM' entry into the top level dictionary
object, but with the recent changes to support incremental update
this is not ideal - it has the effect of forcing all resources
into the new section of the xref.

So we avoid that horrible hack and use a different one; we make use
of the new flags word in the pdf_obj structure. 1 bit is used to
indicate whether we have stashed a (boolean) value here, and another
bit is used to indicate what that value was.

Instead use the recently added `magit-list-refnames'.

This is (only) the starting point to implement more meaningful revision
and reference completion.  `magit-list-interesting-refs' was very very
bad.  Basically it and the code which surrounded it (not all of which
has been replaced yet) took the ""when in doubt, pick the worst possible
option"" approach.  E.g. instead of asking ""what do we have to complete?""
and answering that with (in nine out of ten cases) ""branches"", and then
going on to ""how do we get a list of branches?""; what we actually did
was ""find some git command that gives us a list of refs, pick the first
one, it doesn't matter whether there are better ones"", then start using
it, notice that the completion candidates contain many refs that we are
not interested in, implement ""filter out the uninteresting refs"", and
then keep on complicating things, making it less and less likely that
this will ever be fixed.  Well, I have had it, this crap has to go.

- The OpenSSL x509 has no way to explicitly set the notBefore value on
certificates.

- If two systems have the same configured time, it's possible to return a
certificate before the validity start time has arrived.

- We ""solve"" this by waiting for one second when a certificate is first

Summary:
Fixes T3803. Turns out my advice was sort of terrible. :/

In strict mode, the `INSERT INTO x (y, z)` raises an error unless `(y, z, ...)` includes //all// columns without default values.

Test Plan: Ran `storage upgrade` on a strict-mode install. Verified no inserts were performed.

This fixes a regression from v2.6.27, caused by commit
5814f737e1cd2cfa2893badd62189acae3e1e1fd, ""ACPI: thinkpad-acpi:
attempt to preserve fan state on resume"".

It is possible for fan_suspend() to fail to properly initialize
fan_control_desired_level as required by fan_resume(), resulting on
the fan always being set to level 7 on resume if the user didn't
touch the fan controller.

In order to get fan sleep/resume handling to work right:

1. Fix the fan_suspend handling of the T43 firmware quirk. If it is
still undefined, we didn't touch the fan yet and that means we have no
business doing it on resume.

2. Store the fan level on its own variable to avoid any possible
issues with hijacking fan_control_desired_level (which isn't supposed
to have anything other than 0-7 in it, anyway).

3. Change the fan_resume code to me more straightforward to understand
(although we DO optimize the boolean logic there, otherwise it looks
disgusting).

4. Add comments to help understand what the code is supposed to be
doing.

5. Change fan_set_level to be less strict about how auto and
full-speed modes are requested.

This replaces the (in my opinion horrible) VM_UNMAPPED logic with very
explicit support for a ""remapped page range"" aka VM_PFNMAP.  It allows a
VM area to contain an arbitrary range of page table entries that the VM
never touches, and never considers to be normal pages.

Any user of ""remap_pfn_range()"" automatically gets this new
functionality, and doesn't even have to mark the pages reserved or
indeed mark them any other way.  It just works.  As a side effect, doing
mmap() on /dev/mem works for arbitrary ranges.

Sparc update from David in the next commit.

We do this by lifting parts of the winbindd_dual_pam_auth_crap() code
into a new helper function winbind_dual_SamLogon().  This allows us to
implement the semantics we need for IRPC, without the artifacts of the
winbindd pipe protocol.

UpgradeInProgressError used to be defined in apiserver/admin.go and used
in apiserver/upgrading_root.go. __BUT__, the logic that turns errors
into rpc messages is inside apiserver/common/error.go. This creates a
potential import loop as apiserver already imports common, so common
cannot import apiserver to get a type.

So, to ~~solve~~ workaround this clusterfuck, we move
UpgradeInProgressError to apiserver/params, which everyone imports and
solve the import loop.

This is _SHIT_. apiserver and apiserver/common are clearly the same
package, thay cannot function without each other and have been
bifurcated for reasons that no longer make sense.

Once this PR is landed, I will merge the two packages and then we can
define, and use UpgradeInProgressError in _one_ place, and then we can
also unexport it because things should not be checking for it explicitly
on that apiserver side of the blood/brain RPC layer.

This commit adds a way to leverage the xproperty and startup_id APIs
to persist an execution token across restarts. It allows to use
`awful.rules` on clients that were executed by a previous Awesome
instance.

The main limitations of these methods is the lack of entropy used to
build the token. If the command is the same in multiple
`awful.spawn.once`, then it will not work as expected. To mitigate this
issue, the system try to concatenate the `awful.rules` table after the
command and hash the resulting string. Given rules are a table, it can
have loops and/or issues with keys ordering. The hash function sort and
limite recursion to prevent a stack overflow. Another issue is the
unreliability of startup notifications.

a rectangle is *much* faster to paint than a simple ShapeItem,
so this is a safer choice. We still need to create the paint
method so we can use the correct roundness for the rectangle.
Currently it's white with a 1px solid line - terrible. :)

Holidays are now actual datums with procs and vars and everything.
Holidays run a proc called celebrate() when it's time to celebrate them. Currently none of them do anything but that should change, wink wink.
Holidays can now run for more than a day. The important ones, april fools, christmas, halloween, new years, and easter, all last at least a week. The idea is so people can celebrate christmas in game without having to, you know, actually play on fucking christmas. And also to put a time limit on how long stuff like the annoying spookoween closet skeletons will stick around so it doesn't overstay its welcome and become annoying as shit like last year.
The event SS now allows more than 1 holiday to run at a time. This matters for new years + christmas, easter + april fools, easter + 4/20, and any holiday that can happen on friday the 13th. The events get stored in a list that's only initialized if there's an active holiday so testing for potential holidays is still pretty easy.
Added more easter dates so we won't have to add more until 2040. The current batch run out in 2017.

Summary:
BUG: 346222
BUG: 399992
BUG: 356076
FIXED-IN: 5.15

The QML changes make the tab look and feel less awful:
* make the fake window borders stand out less
* add margins to drop area to make it easier to drop buttons on the title bar (fixing 346222)
* change cursor to a non-pointing one [1]

[1] Drag&drop: When dropping, we receive the position of the button being dropped,
not of the cursor. The two can be far (when starting drag by moving the cursor fast):
which makes the whole experience very confusing, as the user means to drop at cursor location.

Test Plan: Tested drag/drop: same (messy) behavior as before, but can now drop more loosely around titlebar items

Patch series ""psi: pressure stall information for CPU, memory, and IO"", v4.

		Overview

PSI reports the overall wallclock time in which the tasks in a system (or
cgroup) wait for (contended) hardware resources.

This helps users understand the resource pressure their workloads are
under, which allows them to rootcause and fix throughput and latency
problems caused by overcommitting, underprovisioning, suboptimal job
placement in a grid; as well as anticipate major disruptions like OOM.

		Real-world applications

We're using the data collected by PSI (and its previous incarnation,
memdelay) quite extensively at Facebook, and with several success stories.

One usecase is avoiding OOM hangs/livelocks.  The reason these happen is
because the OOM killer is triggered by reclaim not being able to free
pages, but with fast flash devices there is *always* some clean and
uptodate cache to reclaim; the OOM killer never kicks in, even as tasks
spend 90% of the time thrashing the cache pages of their own executables.
There is no situation where this ever makes sense in practice.  We wrote a
<100 line POC python script to monitor memory pressure and kill stuff way
before such pathological thrashing leads to full system losses that would
require forcible hard resets.

We've since extended and deployed this code into other places to guarantee
latency and throughput SLAs, since they're usually violated way before the
kernel OOM killer would ever kick in.

It is available here: https://github.com/facebookincubator/oomd

Eventually we probably want to trigger the in-kernel OOM killer based on
extreme sustained pressure as well, so that Linux can avoid memory
livelocks - which technically aren't deadlocks, but to the user
indistinguishable from them - out of the box.  We'd continue using OOMD as
the first line of defense to ensure workload health and implement complex
kill policies that are beyond the scope of the kernel.

We also use PSI memory pressure for loadshedding.  Our batch job
infrastructure used to use heuristics based on various VM stats to
anticipate OOM situations, with lackluster success.  We switched it to PSI
and managed to anticipate and avoid OOM kills and lockups fairly reliably.
The reduction of OOM outages in the worker pool raised the pool's
aggregate productivity, and we were able to switch that service to smaller
machines.

Lastly, we use cgroups to isolate a machine's main workload from
maintenance crap like package upgrades, logging, configuration, as well as
to prevent multiple workloads on a machine from stepping on each others'
toes.  We were not able to configure this properly without the pressure
metrics; we would see latency or bandwidth drops, but it would often be
hard to impossible to rootcause it post-mortem.

We now log and graph pressure for the containers in our fleet and can
trivially link latency spikes and throughput drops to shortages of
specific resources after the fact, and fix the job config/scheduling.

PSI has also received testing, feedback, and feature requests from Android
and EndlessOS for the purpose of low-latency OOM killing, to intervene in
pressure situations before the UI starts hanging.

		How do you use this feature?

A kernel with CONFIG_PSI=y will create a /proc/pressure directory with 3
files: cpu, memory, and io.  If using cgroup2, cgroups will also have
cpu.pressure, memory.pressure and io.pressure files, which simply
aggregate task stalls at the cgroup level instead of system-wide.

The cpu file contains one line:

	some avg10=2.04 avg60=0.75 avg300=0.40 total=157656722

The averages give the percentage of walltime in which one or more tasks
are delayed on the runqueue while another task has the CPU.  They're
recent averages over 10s, 1m, 5m windows, so you can tell short term
trends from long term ones, similarly to the load average.

The total= value gives the absolute stall time in microseconds.  This
allows detecting latency spikes that might be too short to sway the
running averages.  It also allows custom time averaging in case the
10s/1m/5m windows aren't adequate for the usecase (or are too coarse with
future hardware).

What to make of this ""some"" metric?  If CPU utilization is at 100% and CPU
pressure is 0, it means the system is perfectly utilized, with one
runnable thread per CPU and nobody waiting.  At two or more runnable tasks
per CPU, the system is 100% overcommitted and the pressure average will
indicate as much.  From a utilization perspective this is a great state of
course: no CPU cycles are being wasted, even when 50% of the threads were
to go idle (as most workloads do vary).  From the perspective of the
individual job it's not great, however, and they would do better with more
resources.  Depending on what your priority and options are, raised ""some""
numbers may or may not require action.

The memory file contains two lines:

some avg10=70.24 avg60=68.52 avg300=69.91 total=3559632828
full avg10=57.59 avg60=58.06 avg300=60.38 total=3300487258

The some line is the same as for cpu, the time in which at least one task
is stalled on the resource.  In the case of memory, this includes waiting
on swap-in, page cache refaults and page reclaim.

The full line, however, indicates time in which *nobody* is using the CPU
productively due to pressure: all non-idle tasks are waiting for memory in
one form or another.  Significant time spent in there is a good trigger
for killing things, moving jobs to other machines, or dropping incoming
requests, since neither the jobs nor the machine overall are making too
much headway.

The io file is similar to memory.  Because the block layer doesn't have a
concept of hardware contention right now (how much longer is my IO request
taking due to other tasks?), it reports CPU potential lost on all IO
delays, not just the potential lost due to competition.

		FAQ

Q: How is PSI's CPU component different from the load average?

A: There are several quirks in the load average that make it hard to
   impossible to tell how overcommitted the CPU really is.

   1. The load average is reported as a raw number of active tasks.
      You need to know how many CPUs there are in the system, how many
      CPUs the workload is allowed to use, then think about what the
      proportion between load and the number of CPUs mean for the
      tasks trying to run.

      PSI reports the percentage of wallclock time in which tasks are
      waiting for a CPU to run on. It doesn't matter how many CPUs are
      present or usable. The number always tells the quality of life
      of tasks in the system or in a particular cgroup.

   2. The shortest averaging window is 1m, which is extremely coarse,
      and it's sampled in 5s intervals. A *lot* can happen on a CPU in
      5 seconds. This *may* be able to identify persistent long-term
      trends and very clear and obvious overloads, but it's unusable
      for latency spikes and more subtle overutilization.

      PSI's shortest window is 10s. It also exports the cumulative
      stall times (in microseconds) of synchronously recorded events.

   3. On Linux, the load average for historical reasons includes all
      TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE tasks. This gives a broader sense of how
      busy the system is, but on the flipside it doesn't distinguish
      whether tasks are likely to contend over the CPU or IO - which
      obviously requires very different interventions from a sys admin
      or a job scheduler.

      PSI reports independent metrics for CPU and IO. You can tell
      which resource is making the tasks wait, but in conjunction
      still see how overloaded the system is overall.

Q: What's the cost / performance impact of this feature?

A: PSI's primary cost is in the scheduler, in particular task wakeups
   and sleeps.

   I benchmarked this code using Facebook's two most scheduling
   sensitive workloads: memcache and webserver. They handle a ton of
   small requests - lots of wakeups and sleeps with little actual work
   in between - so they tend to be canaries for scheduler regressions.

   In the tests, the boxes were handling live traffic over the course
   of several hours. Half the machines, the control, ran with
   CONFIG_PSI=n.

   For memcache I used eight machines total. They're 2-socket, 14
   core, 56 thread boxes. The test runs for half the test period,
   flips the test and control kernels on the hardware to rule out HW
   factors, DC location etc., then runs the other half of the test.

   For the webservers, I used 32 machines total. They're single
   socket, 16 core, 32 thread machines.

   During the memcache test, CPU load was nopsi=78.05% psi=78.98% in
   the first half and nopsi=77.52% psi=78.25%, so PSI added between
   0.7 and 0.9 percentage points to the CPU load, a difference of
   about 1%.

   UPDATE: I re-ran this test with the v3 version of this patch set
   and the CPU utilization was equivalent between test and control.

   UPDATE: v4 is on par with v3.

   As far as end-to-end request latency from the client perspective
   goes, we don't sample those finely enough to capture the requests
   going to those particular machines during the test, but we know the
   p50 turnaround time in this workload is 54us, and perf bench sched
   pipe on those machines show nopsi=5.232666 us/op and psi=5.587347
   us/op, so this doesn't add much here either.

   The profile for the pipe benchmark shows:

        0.87%  sched-pipe  [kernel.vmlinux]    [k] psi_group_change
        0.83%  perf.real   [kernel.vmlinux]    [k] psi_group_change
        0.82%  perf.real   [kernel.vmlinux]    [k] psi_task_change
        0.58%  sched-pipe  [kernel.vmlinux]    [k] psi_task_change

   The webserver load is running inside 4 nested cgroup levels. The
   CPU load with both nopsi and psi kernels was indistinguishable at
   81%.

   For comparison, we had to disable the cgroup cpu controller on the
   webservers because it added 4 percentage points to the CPU% during
   this same exact test.

   Versions of this accounting code now run on 80% of our fleet. None
   of our workloads have reported regressions during the rollout.

This patch (of 9):

If we keep just enough refault information to match the *current* page
cache during reclaim time, we could lose a lot of events when there is
only a temporary spike in non-cache memory consumption that pushes out all
the cache.  Once cache comes back, we won't see those refaults.  They
might not be actionable for LRU aging, but we want to know about them for
measuring memory pressure.

bit-twiddling abilities but generally lousy conditional execution perf (although this might
have changed in recent implementations).

x86 also sees some wins, but the effect is limited because these transforms already mostly
exist in its target-specific combineSelectOfTwoConstants(). The fact that we see any x86 
changes just shows that that code is a mess of special-case holes. We may be able to remove 
some of that logic now.

My guess is that other targets will want to enable this hook for most cases. The likely 
follow-ups would be to add value type and/or the constants themselves as parameters for the
hook. As the tests in select_const.ll show, we can transform any select-of-constants to 
math/logic, but the general transform for any 2 constants needs one more instruction 
(multiply or 'and').

ARM is one target that I think may not want this for most cases. I see infinite loops there
because it wants to use selects to enable conditionally executed instructions.

that keep cropping up in the regression test suite.

This also addresses one of the issues raised on the mailing list with
failing to form 'movsd' in as many cases as we realistically should.
There will be corresponding patches forthcoming for v4f32 at least. This
was a lot of fuss for a relatively small gain, but all the fuss was on
my end trying different ways of holding the pieces of the x86 fragment
patterns *just right*. Now that it works, the code is reasonably simple.

In the new test cases I'm adding here, v2i64 sticks out as just plain
horrible. I've not come up with any great ideas here other than that it
would be nice to recognize when we're *going* to take a domain crossing
hit and cross earlier to get the decent instructions. At least with AVX
it is slightly less silly....

Joel Fernandes created a nice patch that cleaned up the duplicate hooks used
by lockdep and irqsoff latency tracer. It made both use tracepoints. But it
caused lockdep to trigger several false positives. We have not figured out
why yet, but removing lockdep from using the trace event hooks and just call
its helper functions directly (like it use to), makes the problem go away.

This is a partial revert of the clean up patch c3bc8fd637a9 (""tracing:

calls for lockdep, but also keeps most of the clean up done to get rid of
the horrible preprocessor if statements.

- Simplify the view menu options and instead of a 'on/off' switch with a radio button, instead replace that with three options.
- Convert the radio buttons to simple menu items. This is actually a hack so that the radio button does not need to be kept in sync with updates fired from hotkey. It would be more ideal to have radio buttons, but then we would need to have a state change listener to update the radio selection when the hotkey for flags is pressed. To avoid this, we can convert to simple menu items. A user should be able to able to see pretty clear which selection is active, losing the radio button is not a terrible loss.

* Encapsulate next draw mode to its owning enum

* Update fully qualified static method call to not be fully qualified

* Cleanup imports after resolving merge conflicts

to input patterns, we can fix X86ISD::CMP and X86ISD::BT as taking
two inputs (which have to be the same type) and *returning an i32*.
This is how the SDNodes get made in the graph, but we weren't able
to model it this way due to deficiencies in the pattern language.

Now we can change things like this:

 def UCOM_FpIr80: FpI_<(outs), (ins RFP80:$lhs, RFP80:$rhs), CompareFP,
-                  [(X86cmp RFP80:$lhs, RFP80:$rhs),
-                   (implicit EFLAGS)]>; // CC = ST(0) cmp ST(i)
+                  [(set EFLAGS, (X86cmp RFP80:$lhs, RFP80:$rhs))]>;

and fix terrible crimes like this:

-def : Pat<(parallel (X86cmp GR8:$src1, 0), (implicit EFLAGS)),
+def : Pat<(X86cmp GR8:$src1, 0),
           (TEST8rr GR8:$src1, GR8:$src1)>;

This relies on matching the result of TEST8rr (which is EFLAGS, which is
an implicit def) to the result of X86cmp, an i32.

The multi-path support is pretty shameful; we can

Some of the AMDGPU stack addressing modes require knowing the sign
bit is zero. We used to accomplish this by custom lowering
frame indexes, and then putting an AssertZext around a
TargetFrameIndex. This required specifically looking for
the AssextZext + frame index pattern which was moderately
disgusting. The same could probably be accomplished
with a target specific node, but would still
require special handling of frame indexes.

Pull SMP hotplug update from Thomas Gleixner:
 ""This contains a trivial typo fix and an extension to the core code for
  dynamically allocating states in the prepare stage.

  The extension is necessary right now because we need a proper way to
  unbreak LTTNG, which iscurrently non functional due to the removal of
  the notifiers. Surely it's out of tree, but it's widely used by
  distros.

  The simple solution would have been to reserve a state for LTTNG, but
  I'm not fond about unused crap in the kernel and the dynamic range,
  which we admittedly should have done right away, allows us to remove
  quite some of the hardcoded states, i.e. those which have no ordering
  requirements. So doing the right thing now is better than having an
  smaller intermediate solution which needs to be reworked anyway""

bugs galore:
	* 0xf380 instead of htons(ETH_P_AARP), etc.  Works only on l-e.
	* back in 2.3.20 driver got readb() and friends instead of
direct dereferencing of iomem.  Somebody got too enthusiatic and replaced
	ntohs(p->mrx_overflow)
with
	ntohs(read(&p->mrx_overflow)
without noticing that (a) the sucker is 16bit and (b) that expression can't possibly
be portable anyway (hell, on l-e it's always less than 256, on b-e it's always a
multiple of 256).  Proper fix is
	swab16(readw(&p->mrx_overflow)
taking into account the conversion done by readw() itself.  That crap happened
in several places; the same fix applies.
	* untranslate() assumes little-endian almost everywhere, except for
the code checking for IPX/AARP packets; there we forgot ntohs(), so that part
only works on big-endian.

Still hardcoded for Tyan S1846.

This slightly increases performance, but it's still pretty horrible.
Some RAM settings are causing a dramatically slow system (confirmed
by comparing memtest performance results of the proprietary BIOS
and our code). Haven't found the problem, yet.

This change refactors and cleans up our handling of name lookup with
LookupDecl. There are several aspects to this refactoring:

  - The criteria for name lookup is now encapsulated into the class
  LookupCriteria, which replaces the hideous set of boolean values
  that LookupDecl currently has.

  - The results of name lookup are returned in a new class
  LookupResult, which can lazily build OverloadedFunctionDecls for
  overloaded function sets (and, eventually, eliminate the need to
  allocate member for OverloadedFunctionDecls) and contains a
  placeholder for handling ambiguous name lookup (for C++).

  - The primary entry points for name lookup are now LookupName (for
    unqualified name lookup) and LookupQualifiedName (for qualified
    name lookup). There is also a convenience function
    LookupParsedName that handles qualified/unqualified name lookup
    when given a scope specifier. Together, these routines are meant
    to gradually replace the kludgy LookupDecl, but this won't happen
    until after we have base class lookup (which forces us to cope
    with ambiguities).

  - Documented the heck out of name lookup. Experimenting a little
    with using Doxygen's member groups to make some sense of the Sema
    class. Feedback welcome!

  - Fixes some lingering issues with name lookup for
  nested-name-specifiers, which now goes through
  LookupName/LookupQualifiedName.

Summary:
Ref T9346. This mostly allows us to give users additional advice based on which instance they are trying to log in to in the Phacility cluster.

It's also slightly more flexible than `auth.login-message` was, and maybe we'll add some more hooks here eventually.

This feels like it's a sidegrade in complexity rather than really an improvement, but not too terrible.

Test Plan:
  - Wrote the custom handler in T9346 to replicate old config functionality.
  - Wrote a smart handler for Phacility that can provide context-sensitive messages based on which OAuth client you're trying to use.

See new message box at top (implementation in next diff):

It appears that hardened gentoo enables ""-fstack-check"" by default for
gcc.

That doesn't work _at_all_ for the kernel, because the kernel stack
doesn't act like a user stack at all: it's much smaller, and it doesn't
auto-expand on use.  So the extra ""probe one page below the stack"" code
generated by -fstack-check just breaks the kernel in horrible ways,
causing infinite double faults etc.

[ I have to say, that the particular code gcc generates looks very
  stupid even for user space where it works, but that's a separate
  issue.  ]

Thanks to @pbauman for figuring this out and explaining it to me.

This is one change we're not going to propagate upstream.

So, it turns out that git doesn't preserve timestamps (which is
reasonable, because you don't want make to hit false negatives when
figuring out what needs to be rebuilt after you checkout an old
commit), and aclocal needs to be rerun if aclocal.m4 is older than
configure.ac (which is reasonable, because that's how we get stuff
fixed in configure via aclocal.m4), and during a checkout git
typically writes aclocal.m4 before configure.ac (which is reasonable,
because alphabet).

So when we check out this libMesh branch, make immediately intuits
that we have an older aclocal.m4 with a milliseconds-newer
configure.ac, and it tries to invoke aclocal to fix that (which is
unreasonable for us, since we want even our git repo users to be able
to run without having autotools installed).

AM_MAINTAINER_MODE, despite being a horrible hack, is by far the
*least* hackish way to fix this.

This change addresses 3 issues to make schema migration less awful.

* Schema migrator should not run concurrently on multiple threads.
  Migrator acquires an exclusive table lock to avoid it.

* Applying migration scripts should not skip migration scripts that are
  not applied yet but older than the latest applied version. This is
  because a pull-request that has larger version of migration script
  could be merged earlier than another pull-request. Even with this
  case, because obviously there're no dependency between those two
  pull-requests (this is an assumption), all of the migration scripts
  should be applied.

* Migration definition files should be separated into files so that
  commit to DatabaseMigrator.java file doesn't cause many conflicts
  that are not obvious to merge.

Pull timer updates from Thomas Gleixner:
 ""The timer departement presents:

   - A rather large rework of the hrtimer infrastructure which
     introduces softirq based hrtimers to replace the spread of
     hrtimer/tasklet combos which force the actual callback execution
     into softirq context. The approach is completely different from the
     initial implementation which you cursed at 10 years ago rightfully.

     The softirq based timers have their own queues and there is no
     nasty indirection and list reshuffling in the hard interrupt
     anymore. This comes with conversion of some of the hrtimer/tasklet
     users, the rest and the final removal of that horrible interface
     will come towards the end of the merge window or go through the
     relevant maintainer trees.

     Note: The top commit merged the last minute bugfix for the 10 years
     old CPU hotplug bug as I wanted to make sure that I fatfinger the
     merge conflict resolution myself.

* g-i-parser: fix race condition (#1881)

* Remove rmtree debugging patch

It is shadowing exceptions thrown from the main ""try"" block of
GDumpParser._execute_binary_get_tree().

There does seem to be a race condition, but it seems to be related to
subprocess.check_call() and what it does on Windows. At the point
xml.[blah].parse() is called, ""dump.xml"" is often absent!

* More tolerant rmtreeing

If shutil.rmtree() is failing due to some funky race condition that results
in files the walk doesn't know about being left, then don't worry about it
and continue.

This may leave uniquely named junk lying around in the build tree, but that
is by design not a problem with g-i-scanner. Just don't install the
tmp-introspectXXXXXX folder by accident.

* giscanner debugging: asserts and waits

Make absence of dump.xml or functions.txt fatal, but only after giving them
plenty of time time to appear.

Yes, this is horrible code. But it fixes broken builds almost completely on
my 64-bit Win7 with NTFS.

* Wait for XML to be parsed completely

It's possible that dump.xml might exist but be incompletely written. This
nasty sleep-till-it-parses loop covers that case.

Plus the usual logging so we can see if it's really needed ☺

In many cases, page tables can be accessed concurrently by either another
CPU (due to things like fast gup) or by the hardware page table walker
itself, which may set access/dirty bits. In such cases, it is important
to use READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE when accessing page table entries so that
entries cannot be torn, merged or subject to apparent loss of coherence
due to compiler transformations.

Whilst there are some scenarios where this cannot happen (e.g. pinned
kernel mappings for the linear region), the overhead of using READ_ONCE
/WRITE_ONCE everywhere is minimal and makes the code an awful lot easier
to reason about. This patch consistently uses these macros in the arch
code, as well as explicitly namespacing pointers to page table entries
from the entries themselves by using adopting a 'p' suffix for the former
(as is sometimes used elsewhere in the kernel source).

lxc-start requires / to be mounted private, otherwise the changes
it does inside the container (both mounts and unmounts) will propagate
out to the host.

We work around this by starting up lxc-start in its own namespace where
we set / to rprivate.

Unfortunately go can't really execute any code between clone and exec,
so we can't do this in a nice way. Instead we have a horrible hack that

Completely remove the postit trampoline

### What was the end-user problem that led to this PR?

The problem was the bundler trampoline we tried to introduce never completely worked, it worked even less with bundler installed as a default gem (as we intend to do with RubyGems, like, a year ago), and it worked by doing disgusting things that we couldn't be confident would work under all circumstances.

### Was was your diagnosis of the problem?

My diagnosis was our best bet was to completely remove the trampoline from bundler itself.
We intend to address the user story of switching bundler versions in RubyGems directly, where the gymnastics required will hopefully be much less obtrusive. Additionally

### What is your fix for the problem, implemented in this PR?

My fix is to completely delete all references to trampolining / postit from Bundler and admit defeat.

### Why did you choose this fix out of the possible options?

I chose this fix because I'm unwilling to maintain the trampoline any longer, and since it's never been enabled, I feel this is my last chance to pull it from Bundler before I'm stuck maintaining code that doesn't work for all eternity. This will also _finally_ unblock me shipping RubyGems 2.7.

- Grant full access moved to debug verbs. 
- Rejuvanate as a verb also still exists in debug verbs.

decnet is the only subsystem left that is relying on the global
netlink attribute buffer rta_buf. It's horrible design and we
want to get rid of it.

This converts all of decnet to do implicit attribute parsing. It
also gets rid of the error prone struct dn_kern_rta.

Yes, the fib_magic() stuff is not pretty.

It's compiled tested but I need someone with appropriate hardware
to test the patch since I don't have access to it.

Charabilities MK3 - The third and probably not last branch of character stuff

Been too long since I've made a merge request. This isn't quite done, but I'd consider it... done ENOUGH that I want to work on something else, and keeping it seperate from master will just cause everyone hassle.

Abilities:
* CA_BOUNCE. Bounce on basically anything! Break bustable blocks downwards! Don't take damage from below, unless it's death pit damage, in which case eat shit! Averages to double the jumpheight of the player.
* CA_TWINSPIN can now break bustable blocks up and down in addition to breaking horizontally. Also, a spring boost.
* CA_HOVER now uses seperate states/frames, has dashmode support, and falls slowly whilst not moving very quickly.
* CA_SLOWFALL gets the CA_HOVER states/frames and dashmode support too.
* CA_HOMINGTHOK now targets Sea Egg fakes and egg guard shields, and uncurls when there's no target. It also shows a target icon.
* CA2_GUNSLINGER. Uses revitem as bullet. Autotargets within range/angle limitations on similar rules to homing attacks. Shows a target icon.
* CA2_MELEE can now break bustable blocks up and down in addition to breaking horizontally, and plays much more fluidly. Also, a spring boost.
* CA2_SPINDASH allows you to roll when landing on any surface when moving fast enough unless you have PF_THOKKED. Also, fixed you being able to roll forever.

Conversions:
* CA_DASHMODE -> SF_DASHMODE
* CA2_MULTIABILITY -> SF_MULTIABILITY
* player.jumping -> PF_STARTJUMP
* pw_ingoop -> CR_BRAKGOOP
* PF_NIGHTSMODE -> CR_NIGHTSMODE
* PF_SUPERREADY -> P_SuperReady()
* SPR2_SPIN -> SPR2_ROLL
* SPR2_DASH -> SPR2_SPIN
* SPR2_PEEL -> SPR2_DASH
* SPR2_SSTD, other super frames -> see below...

Others:
* Super sprites are now seperated from normal sprites via using S_SUPER lump in a skin, rather than being an explicitly named super version of the lump (which required a ton of effort from us to make super versions of all sprite2 names). Accessible via FF_SPR2SUPER.
* Unlockable skin stuff is now netcode synchronised. We won't be repeating 2.1's bullshit if we can help it!
* Host can't switch their skin if there's any restrictions applied, since that was unfair.
* Unique Attraction Shield sound instead of reusing S3nK Thundercoin sound.
* Character select menu code is defuckened.
* Fixed zoom tube camera distance being borq'd by a bug.
* Hudnames are now padded if they're less than 5 symbols long.
* Instead of jump damage when jumping being controlled directly by SF_NOJUMPDAMAGE, it now indirectly controls it via applying the flag PF_NOJUMPDAMAGE.
* SF_FASTEDGE. Does... a fast edge animation, really.
* Fixed some oversights with the SPR2isation of NiGHTS.
* P_SpawnLockOn(player_t player, mobj_t lockon, statenum_t state) function for Lua allowing the homing target visualisation stuff to be done locally without performing horrible, horrible hacks.
* Objects and sounds for the cork, which CA2_GUNSLINGER's main toter uses.

<root>/toaster/charabilities/ has the testing files outside of patch.dta, which is in master.
* srb2win_branch_charabilities.exe.
* player.dta - can't be used with master executables because of sprite2 renaming plus super stuff.
* socchar.wad - very simple WAD which helps test unlocks for the purpose of netplay.

At OLS I had a lot of interest to be able to have the ftrace buffers
dumped on panic.  Usually one would expect to uses kexec and examine
the buffers after a new kernel is loaded. But sometimes the resources
do not permit kdump and kexec, so having an option to still see the
sequence of events up to the crash is very advantageous.

This patch adds the option to have the ftrace buffers dumped to the
console in the latency_trace format on a panic. When the option is set,
the default entries per CPU buffer are lowered to 16384, since the writing
to the serial (if that is the console) may take an awful long time
otherwise.

[
 Changes since -v1:
  Got alpine to send correctly (as well as spell check working).
  Removed config option.
  Moved the static variables into ftrace_dump itself.
  Gave printk a log level.

Currently asm-powerpc/mmu.h has definitions for the 64-bit hash based
MMU.  If CONFIG_PPC64 is not set, it instead includes asm-ppc/mmu.h
which contains a particularly horrible mess of #ifdefs giving the
definitions for all the various 32-bit MMUs.

It would be nice to have the low level definitions for each MMU type
neatly in their own separate files.  It would also be good to wean
arch/powerpc off dependence on the old asm-ppc/mmu.h.

This patch makes a start on such a cleanup by moving the definitions
for the 64-bit hash MMU to their own file, asm-powerpc/mmu_hash64.h.
Definitions for the other MMUs still all come from asm-ppc/mmu.h,
however each MMU type can now be one-by-one moved over to their own
file, in the process cleaning them up stripping them of cruft no
longer necessary in arch/powerpc.

Stuffing all the files together and compiling the resulting blob with
the main program is a terrible idea.

Some files, namely the .S ones, must be run trough the C preprocessor
before assembling them (#2437).

Beside that the aggregate may be mis-compiled due to the presence of
some flags that affect the following code.

For example let's consider two files, a.s and b.s

a.s
```
fn1:
    ret
.data
data1:
    .word 0
```

b.s
```
fn2:
    ret
```

Now, fn1 and fn2 will be both placed in the .text section as intended if
the two files are compiled separately. But if we merge them the `.data`
flag ends up placing fn2 in the wrong section!

This fixes a nasty crash where musl's memset ended up in the
non-executable data segment, leading to too many hours of
head-scratching.

Now when someone reports an article as rotten we log who it was.

Why?
- it makes things more human, it's not just a game of whack-a-mole to
find articles and mark them as rotten
- it allows for conversations to happen between the reporter and the
article contributors
- if notifications are turned off it allows a reader or contributor of the
article to reach out to the rot reporter in order to refresh the article

This commit also refactors the ArticleRottenJob to put all the fetching
logic inside of it. We don't pass a contributors object, or an article, or
a reporter. All of those are fetched at job runtime.

added REPORTER_NAME and REPORTER_URL merge vars.

The old output is horrible and useless when more devices specified.
The old format is also too tricky if more signatures detected. The new
output uses one line for each signature, prefixed by device name.

For example my workstation:

code has been moved to ewmh.lua request::tag handler. The handler
is called either by a volontary screen change or by a forced one.

It also require the awful.rules to be executed. This is done by
default and the user would have to explicitly disable that
behavior. From now on, disabling the rules require the user to

(I was going to call it Marathon Mode, but NiGHTS Mode being right next to it on the menu looked terrible.)

Basically a dedicated Record Attack-like experience for speedrunning the game as a continuous chunk rather than ILs. Has several quality of life features.

Benefits include:
* An unambiguous real-time bar across the bottom of the screen, always displaying the current time, ticking up until you reach the ending.
* Disable the console (pausing is still allowed, but the timer will still increment).
* Automatically skip intermissions as if you're holding down the spin button.
* Show centiseconds on HUD automatically, like record attack.
* ""Live Event Backups"" - a category of run fit for major events like GDQ, where recovery from crashes or chokes makes for better entertainment. Essentially a modified SP savefile, down to using the same basic functions, but has its own filename and tweaked internal layout.
* ""spmarathon_start"" MainCfg block parameter and ""marathonnext"" mapheader parameter, allowing for a customised flow (makes this fit for purpose for an eventual SUGOI port).
* Disabling inter-level custom cutscenes by default with a menu option to toggle this (won't show up if the mod doesn't *have* any custom cutscenes), although either way ending cutscenes (vanilla or custom) remain intact since is time is called before them.
* Won't show up if you have a mod that consists of only one level (determined by spmarathon_start's nextlevel; this won't trip if you manually set its marathonnext).
* Unconditional gratitude on the evaluation screen, instead of a negging ""Try again..."" if you didn't get all the emeralds (which you may not have been aiming for).
* Gorgeous new menu (no new assets required, unless you wanna give it a header later).

Changes which were required for the above but affect other areas of the game include:
* ""useBlackRock"" MainCFG block parameter, which can be used to disable the presence of the Black Rock or Egg Rock in both the Evaluation screen and the Marathon Run menu (for total conversions with different stories).
* Disabling Continues in NiGHTS mode, to match the most common singleplayer experience post 2.2.4's release (is reverted if useContinues is set to true).
* Hiding the exitmove ""powerup"" outside of multiplayer. (Okay, this isn't really related, I just saw this bug in action a lot while doing test runs and got annoyed enough to fix it here.)
* The ability to use V_DrawPromptBack (in hardcode only at the moment, but) to draw in terms of pixels rather than rows of text, by providing negative instead of positive inputs).
* A refactoring of redundant game saves smattered across the ending, credits, and evaluation - in addition to saving the game slightly earlier.
* Minor m_menu.c touchups and refactorings here and there.

`awful.titlebar.widget.button` and other specific button widgets) could
not be garbage collected until the associated client was unmanaged,
because the signal connection used to update the widget was never
destroyed, and the signal handling function was keeping a reference to
the widget in its environment.  This resulted in high memory usage when
the titlebar widgets were recreated multiple times for the same client
(this does not happen with the default Awesome configuration, but may be
needed for dynamic titlebar reconfiguration in a custom config).

Modify the code to use weak tables instead of direct signal connections
to avoid keeping strong references to widgets.  The widget update
functions still keep strong references to the widget itself (creating a
reference loop, but the Lua GC should handle it correctly) and the
client object, but this should not be a problem.

One publicly visible change is that `awful.titlebar.widget.titlewidget`
now has an `update` function, like the button widgets.

ordering.

The fundamental problem that we're hitting here is that the use-def
chain ordering is *itself* not a stable thing to be relying on in the
rewriting for SROA. Further, we use a non-stable sort over the slices to
arrange them based on the section of the alloca they're operating on.
With a debugging STL implementation (or different implementations in
stage2 and stage3) this can cause stage2 != stage3.

The specific aspect of this problem fixed in this commit deals with the
rewriting and load-speculation around PHIs and Selects. This, like many
other aspects of the use-rewriting in SROA, is really part of the
""strong SSA-formation"" that is doen by SROA where it works very hard to
canonicalize loads and stores in *just* the right way to satisfy the
needs of mem2reg[1]. When we have a select (or a PHI) with 2 uses of the
same alloca, we test that loads downstream of the select are
speculatable around it twice. If only one of the operands to the select
needs to be rewritten, then if we get lucky we rewrite that one first
and the select is immediately speculatable. This can cause the order of
operand visitation, and thus the order of slices to be rewritten, to
change an alloca from promotable to non-promotable and vice versa.

The fix is to defer all of the speculation until *after* the rewrite
phase is done. Once we've rewritten everything, we can accurately test
for whether speculation will work (once, instead of twice!) and the
order ceases to matter.

This also happens to simplify the other subtlety of speculation -- we
need to *not* speculate anything unless the result of speculating will
make the alloca fully promotable by mem2reg. I had a previous attempt at
simplifying this, but it was still pretty horrible.

There is actually already a *really* nice test case for this in
basictest.ll, but on multiple STL implementations and inputs, we just
got ""lucky"". Fortunately, the test case is very small and we can
essentially build it in exactly the opposite way to get reasonable
coverage in both directions even from normal STL implementations.

Thanks to @Markismus's questions, I realized that some of what i thought
was true, wasn't.

First, pkill is a terrible idea to check for interpreted scripts.
Second, pidof is also potentially not that great for interpreted
scripts, because it'll only work with a shebang, and one that is
following the Linux syntax.
We don't have the full version with the -x to paper over that,
so use pgrep -f instead.

This code is completely wrong. It is also dead, as if it were to *ever*

at least *possible* to reach the code, and llvm-stress has found a test
case. Thanks to Patrick for reporting.

It would be really good if anyone who remembers how this code works and
what it was intended to do could add some more obvious test coverage
instead of my completely contrived and reduced test case. My test case
was so brittle I left a bread crumb comment in it to help the next
person to stumble on it and not know what it was actually testing for.

them to an article from the staleness mailer. Authors needs to read the article

If it is stale, then they can edit it and they will be take back to show where

[2.1] [HttpKernel] File storage for profiler

Symfony2 has some problems when dealing with multiple concurrency queries in the SQLite storage, resulting in a timeout error or terrible lack.

I've implemented after discussions with @fabpot a filesystem storage.

Enable it in your project with :

    framework:
        profiler:
          dsn:             ""file:%kernel.cache_dir%/profiler""

I also studied the possibility to store only big data string in files and rest in the SQLite, but not concluant.

Results of my measures (4 concurrency, 120 total) :

* SQLite with data : 1057ms
* SQLite without data : 615ms
* MySQL : 40ms
* This File storage : 54ms

An idea for the find method : a csv file containing ip;url;token

The iteration could be done over a big file, without loading the whole file in memory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by alexandresalome at 2011/07/23 14:22:32 -0700

OK new version, with as explained previously : a CSV file containing the index + file for each profile.

The speed is similar to the speed of MySQL, and no memory overhead should occur with this solution.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by alexandresalome at 2011/07/23 14:37:14 -0700

Hm... Created tests, duplicated from SqliteProfilerStorageTest.

Any idea on how to put this code in common ? Is it usual to create a base class for 2 tests ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by alexandresalome at 2011/07/23 14:48:39 -0700

Just tested with 24.000 requests, the 24.001'th request still takes less than 50ms to execute.

The index file is about 2Mb, and iterating the whole file is fast.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by alexandresalome at 2011/07/23 14:53:19 -0700

I've filled the file with 120Mb of data, requests are still less than 50ms for executing.

Iterating the index takes more than 30s (so it crashed), but it's because of the amount of lines. 30 seconds = 1,400,000 lines in this computer. The file = 1,500,000 lines

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by alexandresalome at 2011/07/23 14:56:54 -0700

I've tested it with Linux, is someone can test with Windows

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stloyd at 2011/07/24 00:32:32 -0700

IMO to speedup it a bit more and not end up with ""crash"" (to not end with ""limit"" of files per directory, also to many files in dir slow down every OS) you should use same method to write as Twig, split up files in to directories. If you do this you can speed up index more, because you can create smaller one per directory.

Also you should fix CS (coding standards).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stloyd at 2011/07/24 02:10:20 -0700

Tested on Win 7, seems ok. Similar speed to sqlite, dunno why ;-) but used a bit less of memory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by alexandresalome at 2011/07/24 02:13:21 -0700

Did you tried with concurrent requests ? It makes sense when you use assetic
and your browser hits the application 4 times simultaneously for CSS
generation

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by alexandresalome at 2011/07/24 02:17:23 -0700

I used Apache Benchmark for producing results :

    ab -c 4 -n 120 URL

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by alexandresalome at 2011/07/24 02:56:55 -0700

OK I used subfolders, based on last characters (because the first part of token is mostly the same between queries.

Error reporting is moved to ContextErrors to disentangle stuff in Macros.scala.
With logics and error reporting intertwined it was an awful mess.

Exceptions are used for the same reason. Instead of threading failures through
the code polluting it with options/ifs, I outline the success path.

It worked much better for typedMacroBody, but I'm also happy with the resulting
code of macroExpand. To me a major factor towards applicability of exceptions
was that they are short-lived and that there might be max one error per domain,
after which we unconditionally bail.

* Cutscene text now supports lowercase (intro and custom).

My experience going from 3.6.5 to 3.7.0 was that backward compatibility is going to be a serious problem for user scripts. I don't want things to just break, so instead let's keep scripts at their initial python version forever. This seems to be keeping in the spirit of having a squillion versions of Python installed because nobody wants to maintain software because software is terrible. I'm sorry for making it worse.

Details:

ARCify NSFileManager+iTerm

Respect python version in setup.py.

For basic scripts, change shebang to give 2-part python version. When running a basic script, use that version.

If a particular python version is needed but is not present download the newest runtime that includes it.

Change semantics of runtimes in the app support directory. iterm2env is the latest, iterm2env-N is runtime version N, and iterm2env-X.Y is python version X.Y (latest downloaded bugfix) and iterm2env-X.Y.Z is python version X.Y.Z. They are trees of hard links so they can survive deletion of each other as upgrades happen.

When installing a python runtime for a full environment script create hard links, don't unzip. This saves disk space. This means the zip files don't need to be saved (so they are not saved)

Write out setup.py files for full environment scripts including python_requires='=x.y.z'. Scripts will be frozen at their initial python version to avoid nasty surprises when upgrading.

Update the basic script templates to specify Python 3.7. I'll need to keep these up to date as new versions of Python come out.

Summary:
Simplify the logic of picking a random double. Instead of doing some arbitrary
walk inside a hash, just take the first 8 bytes and seed a random generator, of
which we ask for a double.

This fixes the problem that the value was previously quantized to 0/255.0
through 255/255.0.

Additionally, the returned value is 0 to 1 exclusive instead of inclusive. This
fixes the problem that the last element of a set is never picked when the
result is 1, which used to occur 1/255 of the time.

Since the picking logic is now correct, we don't need this stupid hack to
return a default value if picking fails, so I removed it.

Also simplify the picking logic code to just keep subtracting the picked value
until it's less than zero.

Test Plan: The test are still kind of terrible, but they probably wouldn't fail now.

The iSeries viodasd drivers does some very strange things with
scatterlists, one of these causing a BUG_ON to trigger when
scatterlist debugging is enabled due to initializing the
scatterlist with memset instead of sg_init_table().

This fixes it by using sg_init_table().  The rest of the stuff
it does to that poor list is still pretty awful but it will work.

I may look into fixing things in a nicer way some other time.

About The Pull Request

Permanent portals no longer randomly select a portal to use as their exit, and instead stick with the first one they find, they're supposed to only have one linked portal anyways.

Adds a portal exit landmark, one-way portals use this to define their exit as opposed to the weird as hell and pointless portal deletion system I was using before, also nice for mapping since they have different icons so you can more easily tell which is which.

Adds One-Use portals, they're just one-way portals that delete after they're used, was requested for a reference off-station thing someone was making, probably also useful for things like mobs that die and spawn portals to an area, most likely will be used in ice moon.

Goat ruin was the only thing using the permanent portal system for ruins so far since VR hub got removed, so I just moved that over to use the landmarks.
Why It's Good For The Game

The old code is garbage I wrote like a year ago because it was packaged with VR hub, and someone added copy-pasta at some point, absolutely terrible. This cuts down on a lot.

The original sh64 toolchains required that we tune the ISA
level accordingly to not have head.S/entry.S blow up. With
current toolchains, this is no longer the case, and the
syntax magically changed as well, causing all current
toolchains to die a horrible death.

Incidentally, code generation in other parts of the kernel
is now significantly complex enough that none of the older
toolchains make it very far these days, so there's not
even any point in preserving legacy compatability via
as-option.

This fixes a long-standing issue, as noted here:

	http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/1/5/223

Though at the time the current toolchains were too broken
to make adjusting the tuning worthwhile.

If it is found that we need to pre-read some blocks before a write
can succeed, we normally set STRIPE_DELAYED and don't actually perform
the read until STRIPE_PREREAD_ACTIVE subsequently gets set.

However for a degraded RAID6 we currently perform the reads as soon
as we see that a write is pending.  This significantly hurts
throughput.

So:
 - when handle_stripe_dirtying find a block that it wants on a device
   that is failed, set STRIPE_DELAY, instead of doing nothing, and
 - when fetch_block detects that a read might be required to satisfy a
   write, only perform the read if STRIPE_PREREAD_ACTIVE is set,
   and if we would actually need to read something to complete the write.

This also helps RAID5, though less often as RAID5 supports a
read-modify-write cycle.  For RAID5 the read is performed too early
only if the write is not a full 4K aligned write (i.e. no an
R5_OVERWRITE).

Also clean up a couple of horrible bits of formatting.

To this end, SkyframePackageLoaderWithValueEnvironment.getLoadedTarget() doesn't resolve //external: labels anymore. This was only needed for JVM resolution, which was dealt with by adding and extra RedirectChaser.followRedirect() call to JvmConfigurationLoader. One hack less.

On the flip side, BazelConfigurationCollection.collectTransitiveClosure() grew a hack to handle bind(), but that method is awful enough as it is anyway.

The basic issue is to be able to do what hugetlbfs does but with
different page sizes for some other special filesystems; more
specifically, my need is:

 - Huge pages

 - SPE local store mappings using 64K pages on a 4K base page size
kernel on Cell

 - Some special 4K segments in 64K-page kernels for mapping a dodgy
type of powerpc-specific infiniband hardware that requires 4K MMU
mappings for various reasons I won't explain here.

The main issues are:

 - To maintain/keep track of the page size per ""segment"" (as we can
only have one page size per segment on powerpc, which are 256MB
divisions of the address space).

 - To make sure special mappings stay within their allotted
""segments"" (including MAP_FIXED crap)

 - To make sure everybody else doesn't mmap/brk/grow_stack into a
""segment"" that is used for a special mapping

Some of the necessary mechanisms to handle that were present in the
hugetlbfs code, but mostly in ways not suitable for anything else.

The patch relies on some changes to the generic get_unmapped_area()
that just got merged.  It still hijacks hugetlb callbacks here or
there as the generic code hasn't been entirely cleaned up yet but
that shouldn't be a problem.

So what is a slice ?  Well, I re-used the mechanism used formerly by our
hugetlbfs implementation which divides the address space in
""meta-segments"" which I called ""slices"".  The division is done using
256MB slices below 4G, and 1T slices above.  Thus the address space is
divided currently into 16 ""low"" slices and 16 ""high"" slices.  (Special
case: high slice 0 is the area between 4G and 1T).

Doing so simplifies significantly the tracking of segments and avoids
having to keep track of all the 256MB segments in the address space.

While I used the ""concepts"" of hugetlbfs, I mostly re-implemented
everything in a more generic way and ""ported"" hugetlbfs to it.

Slices can have an associated page size, which is encoded in the mmu
context and used by the SLB miss handler to set the segment sizes.  The
hash code currently doesn't care, it has a specific check for hugepages,
though I might add a mechanism to provide per-slice hash mapping
functions in the future.

The slice code provide a pair of ""generic"" get_unmapped_area() (bottomup
and topdown) functions that should work with any slice size.  There is
some trickiness here so I would appreciate people to have a look at the
implementation of these and let me know if I got something wrong.

Back in the early days of the pvrusb2 driver, the kernel class
mechanism in use for the sysfs interface had no means to pass
per-attribute information to the show / store functions.  This forced
me to implement a horrible ugly thunking mechanism (i.e. infer the
missing data through the use of dedicated cookie cutter bounce
functions).  However now we're using a better mechanism which also
passes enough additional information to the show / store functions
that we no longer need the hack.  So eliminate all the crap.  Yay!

About The Pull Request

Completely removes item_color and the clusterfuck of bad programming it caused.

In places where item_color was used for entirely unique purposes it was split off and renamed to a new var on that typepath only, or refactored so it wasn't needed

In places where item_color was used as a dye color, it was converted to the new dye_color var

In places where item_color was used as the worn overlay it was removed and instead now icon_state is always used as the clothing overlay.

A new mob_overlay_icon var was added for manually setting where the mob overlay icon path is for specific items.

Moved some mob overlay files relating to clothing to their own directory as well for organization purposes.

Totally refactors washing machines, instead of the horrible abortion that was iterating through the typepath it now uses a registry of dye results.

Some bonus functionality to come out of this:
the washing machine now supports arbitrary dye colors.
Why It's Good For The Game

It's been 4 years since the ""this should be deprecated soonish"" comment was added, and this var is a shitpile of confusion if you just trace the usage of it.

This served as a low-level check that we're not executing a command
against a relation that consists of more than 1 tuple *while* the
command was configured to return only 1 result.

At the end of the day this doesn't feel right. First of all we hit the
db with a count query before executing a command, which may have
horrible performance impact. Secondly, this adds *a requirement* for
every adapter that it needs to implement commands where `tuple_count` calls
`relation#count` thus expecting adapter's relation to provide `#count`.

This way we reduce the overhead for command execution *and* narrow down
the adapter interface even more.

The *downside* of this removal is that if you're using commands directly
(ie not via repository) you need to make sure that you're not calling an
update or delete command on a relation that wasn't properly restricted
(assuming it is needed).

Good news is that with rom-repository supporting commands this kind of
low-level checks are simply not needed, because command methods in
repositories restrict relations by default and expect restriction
arguments to be provided, so it's impossible to call a command by an
accident on a relation that includes more tuples than expected. ie
`user_repo.delete(1)` or `user_repo.update(2, name: ""Jane"")`.

The problem was that get_square_distance() made the screen one pixel larger to
the bottom/right than it really was. Thus, the (x+0,y+0)-pixel of a screen that
was below or to the right of some other screen had distance zero to both of
these screens.

This commit fixes the screen size computation and adds a small unit test for
getbycoord() and get_square_distance().

By setting the textbox in an align layout's middle, the submenu icon will always
get the space it needs and the textbox will get the rest. Previously, the

Sadly there's only 1 driver which can use it, everyone else is special
for some reason:

- gma500 has a horrible runtime PM ioctl wrapper that probably doesn't
  really work but meh.
- i915 needs special compat_ioctl handler because regrets.
- arcgpu needs to fixup the pgprot because (no idea why it can't do
  that in the fault handler like everyone else).
- tegra does even worse stuff with pgprot
- udl does something with vm_flags too ...
- cma helpers, etnaviv, mtk, msm, rockchip, omap all implement some
  variation on prefaulting.
- exynos is exynos, I got lost in the midlayers.
- vc4 has to reinvent half of cma helpers because those are too much
  midlayer, plus vm_flags dances.
- vgem also seems unhappy with the default vm_flags.

So pretty sad divergence and I'm sure we could do better, but not
really an idea. Oh well, maybe this macro here helps to encourage more
consistency at least going forward.

One is that some connection queries specify a sort order, but some returned fields have the same value for the sort field. The behavior here is undefined, but by default sift will order by the order they were added to Gatsby. While that's not a terrible default, it makes testing sift and loki compatibility hard, since loki has undefined ordering for this case.

cl Time-Green
add: Adds plumbing pipes and some hidden plumbing related machines. They're not available in-game yet.
sprites: Geyser and geyser pump sprites created by Mey-Ha-Zah!
/cl
Adds the following objects:

    Fluid ducts . Like atmos pipe, but for reagents. They're smart and can be seperated by layer and color

    Geysers. They spawn on lavaland and can be harvested with liquid pumps or just beakers.

    Liquid pumps. For pumping geysers. They need to be on a wire node and connected to a duct network.

    Plumbable reagent dispenser subtype.

    New plumbing RPD specific RPD.

    Plungers. The reinforced plunger can be used for plunging geysers to activate them. They currently serve no other function and can't be worn as a hat yet.

They're all disabled and admin only.

Adds the following systems:

    Ductnet datum. They pretty much say ""hey, we're connected""

    Plumbing component. You can turn any movable atom into a plumbable thing. Comes with overlays and everything. They're essential for everything that has input and outputs, except pipes. That means you can have machines connected to both atmospheric pipes and fluid ducts. They only connect with layer 3 ducts.

    Fluid subsystem that handles the processing on the plumbing machinery and other plumbing related stuff.

Basically atmospherics but with reagents. Reagents are pressurized and thus transferred instantly, to avoid those stupid leftovers in pipes no one likes. I am PRing it now because if I were to add a dozen or so associated machines, it would be too much of a pain to manage/review in one PR. It would also be a massive waste if people didn't even want it in the first place.

Also yes all of this works (as far as I know)

Things I plan to add in later PR's

    Layers / colors (maybe) done
    Machinery (Stuff like chemical processors, filters, special mixing chambers and factories)
    Make geysers more interesting, so chemists/atmostechs/cargotechs/assistants can go to lavaland and get some exotic stuff.
    Pipe fractures. Damaged pipes could do the cartooney water soaker beam coming out to shoot at people cause why the fuck not.

Code concerns:

    Connecting is handled through pipes only. Not sure if this is the best approach. This means plumbing devices cant directly connect to each other without pipes. I could add some exceptions to handle it. I could also take connecting away from pipes and make it a global proc, with alot of exceptions since it'd be handling both plumbing machinery and the ducts.

    Reagent transferring. Basically the transfer is instantaneous from A to B. I did this because stuff getting stuck in pipes could pose some serious mixing problems with chemistry, since it's alot more delicate than atmos. I could understand if people would want it to be like atmos. It wouldn't be difficult to change.

Also for testing I suggest you set the pipe_dispenser to category 3 to print fluid ducts. My tests were done with

So I _should_ have looked at other unserialized users of ->load_avg,
but alas. Luckily nikbor reported a similar /0 from task_h_load() which
instantly triggered recollection of this here problem.

Aside from the intermediate value hitting memory and causing problems,
there's another problem: the underflow detection relies on the signed
bit. This reduces the effective width of the variables, IOW its
effectively the same as having these variables be of signed type.

This patch changes to a different means of unsigned underflow
detection to not rely on the signed bit. This allows the variables to
use the 'full' unsigned range. And it does so with explicit LOAD -
STORE to ensure any intermediate value will never be visible in
memory, allowing these unserialized loads.

Note: GCC generates crap code for this, might warrant a look later.

Note2: I say 'full' above, if we end up at U*_MAX we'll still explode;
       maybe we should do clamping on add too.

* Bugfix:  Initiative adds bonus to target DC

Rolling initiative with the deluxe rules now proper adds Dex+Misc Bonus to target DC rather than as a modifier to the roll.

* Bugfix:  Luck now adds bonuses to target DC

Luck rolls now add bonuses to the target DC instead of as a modifier to the roll.

* Bugfix:  Luck rolls now check for minimum luck.

Luck rolls now check that your Luck rolls are using the proper minimum of 1/2 your level.

* Feature:  GS and TF are automatically calculated

Great Success and Terrible Failure DC values no longer need to be entered manually.  They are automatically calculated from your attribute scores.

* Feature:  Add XP and XP goal fields

In preparation for the optional XP rules provided in the LFG Companion book, XP and XP goal fields have been added.

* Bugfix:  Level field now has default value of 1

Level field didn't have a default value, and this caused a syntax error with luck saves if a level is never added.

* Bugfix:  Capped ""Terrible Failure"" score at 20.

This will provide the analogous replacements for the PassManagerBuilder
and other code long term. This code is extracted from the opt tool
currently, and I plan to extend it as I build up support for using the
new pass manager in Clang and other places.

Mailing this out for review in part to let folks comment on the terrible names
here. A brief word about why I chose the names I did.

The library is called ""Passes"" to try and make it clear that it is a high-level
utility and where *all* of the passes come together and are registered in
a common library. I didn't want it to be *limited* to a registry though, the
registry is just one component.

The class is a ""PassBuilder"" but this name I'm less happy with. It doesn't
build passes in any traditional sense and isn't a Builder-style API at all. The
class is a PassRegisterer or PassAdder, but neither of those really make a lot
of sense. This class is responsible for constructing passes for registry in an
analysis manager or for population of a pass pipeline. If anyone has a better
name, I would love to hear it. The other candidate I looked at was
PassRegistrar, but that doesn't really fit either. There is no register of all
the passes in use, and so I think continuing the ""registry"" analog outside of
the registry of pass *names* and *types* is a mistake. The objects themselves
are just objects with the new pass manager.

There are a lot of one-liner uses of __setup() in the kernel: they're
cumbersome and not queryable (definitely not settable) via /sys.  Yet
it's ugly to simplify them to module_param(), because by default that
inserts a prefix of the module name (usually filename).

So, introduce a ""core_param"".  The parameter gets no prefix, but
appears in /sys/module/kernel/parameters/ (if non-zero perms arg).  I
thought about using the name ""core"", but that's more common than
""kernel"".  And if you create a module called ""kernel"", you will die
a horrible death.

The following patch merges the mmu and non-mmu versions of the m68k
bitops.h files. Now there is a good deal of difference between the two
files, but none of it is actually an mmu specific difference. It is
all about the specific m68k/coldfire varient we are targeting. So it
makes an awful lot of sense to merge these into a single bitops.h.

There is a number of ways I can see to factor this code. The approach
I have taken here is to keep the various versions of each macro/function
type together. This means that there is some ifdefery with each to handle
each CPU type.

I have added some comments in a couple of appropriate places to try
and make it clear what the differences we are dealing with are.
Specifically the instruction and addressing mode differences we have
to deal with.

The merged form keeps the same underlying optimizations for each CPU
type for all the general bit clear/set/change and find bit operations.
It does switch to using the generic le operations though, instead of
any local varients.

Build tested on ColdFire, 68328, 68360 (which is cpu32) and 68020+.
Run tested on ColdFire and ARAnyM.

Switching to blank NAND when emulation is running is an extremely bad
idea. It's akin to opening up a Wii and replacing the NAND chip while
you're playing a game on it.

Except we're not even replacing it with a NAND that has the same
contents. The blank NAND has nothing in it except the save file for
the current game, which is likely to result in the emulated software
getting inconsistent results and possibly even crashing depending on
how it caches title information.

An example of games that check the saves for other games is
Mario Kart Wii -- it checks the filesystem for Super Mario Galaxy saves
to decide whether to unlock characters. With this 'switch NAND
while emulation is active' misfeature, this will likely break.
And that's the main problem: it encourages sloppy emulation and no one
really knows how many things it can break.

Just don't let the user do horrible things like that during emulation.
If they want to use a blank NAND, they can do so by starting input
recording before launching a game. It's likely they will want to do
this if they plan to share their DTM anyway.

Rewrite the vmap allocator to use rbtrees and lazy tlb flushing, and
provide a fast, scalable percpu frontend for small vmaps (requires a
slightly different API, though).

The biggest problem with vmap is actually vunmap.  Presently this requires
a global kernel TLB flush, which on most architectures is a broadcast IPI
to all CPUs to flush the cache.  This is all done under a global lock.  As
the number of CPUs increases, so will the number of vunmaps a scaled
workload will want to perform, and so will the cost of a global TLB flush.
 This gives terrible quadratic scalability characteristics.

Another problem is that the entire vmap subsystem works under a single
lock.  It is a rwlock, but it is actually taken for write in all the fast
paths, and the read locking would likely never be run concurrently anyway,
so it's just pointless.

This is a rewrite of vmap subsystem to solve those problems.  The existing
vmalloc API is implemented on top of the rewritten subsystem.

The TLB flushing problem is solved by using lazy TLB unmapping.  vmap
addresses do not have to be flushed immediately when they are vunmapped,
because the kernel will not reuse them again (would be a use-after-free)
until they are reallocated.  So the addresses aren't allocated again until
a subsequent TLB flush.  A single TLB flush then can flush multiple
vunmaps from each CPU.

XEN and PAT and such do not like deferred TLB flushing because they can't
always handle multiple aliasing virtual addresses to a physical address.
They now call vm_unmap_aliases() in order to flush any deferred mappings.
That call is very expensive (well, actually not a lot more expensive than
a single vunmap under the old scheme), however it should be OK if not
called too often.

The virtual memory extent information is stored in an rbtree rather than a
linked list to improve the algorithmic scalability.

There is a per-CPU allocator for small vmaps, which amortizes or avoids
global locking.

To use the per-CPU interface, the vm_map_ram / vm_unmap_ram interfaces
must be used in place of vmap and vunmap.  Vmalloc does not use these
interfaces at the moment, so it will not be quite so scalable (although it
will use lazy TLB flushing).

As a quick test of performance, I ran a test that loops in the kernel,
linearly mapping then touching then unmapping 4 pages.  Different numbers
of tests were run in parallel on an 4 core, 2 socket opteron.  Results are
in nanoseconds per map+touch+unmap.

threads           vanilla         vmap rewrite
1                 14700           2900
2                 33600           3000
4                 49500           2800
8                 70631           2900

So with a 8 cores, the rewritten version is already 25x faster.

In a slightly more realistic test (although with an older and less
scalable version of the patch), I ripped the not-very-good vunmap batching
code out of XFS, and implemented the large buffer mapping with vm_map_ram
and vm_unmap_ram...  along with a couple of other tricks, I was able to
speed up a large directory workload by 20x on a 64 CPU system.  I believe
vmap/vunmap is actually sped up a lot more than 20x on such a system, but
I'm running into other locks now.  vmap is pretty well blown off the
profiles.

fix: Added a cooldown for datum outputs
/cl

also added an arg called do_owner in playsound that lets the owner of a datum output be different from the atom that plays it, chiefly used for component/squeak so that you can apply the component directly to any single atom without having to fuck with said atom's datum_outputs list so that it can properly play the sound, since the datum output is already stored within the datum component itself.

The panel itself has been updated with subcategories and additional options.  The ""air regulator"" option was removed because what even does that mean.  The Suit Up option has been fixed, and should work properly now.  Additional items include an all-access ID, RCD, flashlight, light replacer, plasteel, cable, floorbot, medbot, gas mask, and emergency air tank.

The hrefs var was moved out of global scope because that's a terrible place for something so generically named.

The Spawn Item and Spawn Canister dialogs now use a browser window instead of a pick list.  This window is cached per user.

Sandbox's Spawn Airlock option gets a new interface.  It allows you to pick the accesses of the new airlock, as well as its paintjob, name, glass inserts where appropriate, and an option to make the access list ""require one"" instead of ""require all.""  It adds an airlock frame which can be repositioned; attack-hand-ing the airlock frame (if it has the airlock builder datum attached) will now open the window.

An administrative option has been added to the sandbox panel, which is configurable through game_options.txt.  Because the item spawning uses a persistent browser window, it is susceptible to spamming.  The added option forces the window closed after each item is spawned.  This only affects the item and canister selection windows, and not the whole sandbox panel.

spaces (aka ServerID13435674980 instead of ServerID: 23234)
*Fixed a bug where the logger will not log random messages.
*Fixed a bug with the help command where it will not send a message if
you didn't have
a message already sent to the bot.
*Fixed a bug where the bot might fail to start.
*Fixed a bug that made the bot to slow at responding messages.
*Fixed a bug in the osu command that made it fail to take an argument on
recent.

writting to the file.
*Fixed a bug in the JSON reading where it might return null at random
times
*Fixed a bug in the custom prefix handler where it might return null at

*Fixed a bug where files would load at a seemingly random rate, creating
conflicts and null fields.
*Fixed a bug where Timers were unidentifiable (changed to Executors,
thanks Adriano)
*Fixed a bug where threads might leak out of nowhere (Changed to
ThreadPools, thanks Adriano)
*Fixed a bug where LogListener might not report the deleted/edited
message and will just return an empty one. (Just ignore it)
*Fixed a bug where it might ignore some guilds.
*Fixed a bug where some guilds will not accept logging channels.

finishing another command. (Will respond after the command finishes
processing anyway)

* reworks the arcade game completly

gaming

* parenthesis more like orphanesis

* adds the ""emag mode""

emag mode is simple, cuban pete has all 6 traits at his disposal. The current best tactic I could find is 4 defend in a row to get rid of the magical trait, followed by 3 power attacks, which will both get rid of the shotgun and chonker trait

then hope to fucking hell that the short temper trait keeps cuban pete from hitting you and spam light attacks until he hopefully dies. Counter attacking is basically useless because of the smart/magical combo so don't even try to do that.

* fixes a fucky wucky

fucked up a thing and you weren't able to restart a game, also rebalance a few things.

* replace nearly every list by a lazylist

* fixes a bug with the arcade action

the arcade action didn't properly translate the href so I just made the enemy_action take a string directly instead of the entire href_list

* gives cuban pete a special bomb move

cuban pete works in a timer, after 18 turn the bomb will explode and basically reduce the player to fucking dust. It took a bunch of testing but I did manage to balance it relatively well, better gaming skill will also give you more HP

* makes the finishing move last through multiple turns

Now when the finishing move is ready you'll be able to use it whenever you want not just next turn, even multiple time in a row, unless you restart a game of course.

* makes the shotgun passive change the chosen_weapon

also slightly reform a few things so that the ""bomb"" text is always before any passive.

* Nemvar how dare you help me improve my code

fixes a couple of thingies

* I like my comments like I like my women

not with an indentation in their skull

* fixes a few problem with the magical passive

* change gameover_check a little

make it so the player HP will be set to 1 if its under 0 and the enemy HP is under 0 for the rare case where the enemy kills you and die in their own turn.

Mainly here so it doesn't look weird that both you and your enemy are dead and yet you still win.

* put an anti runtime mesure

shouldn't happen but gives a default weapon of ""null gun"" if the weapons list is somehow empty. just in case.

* assoc list change

changes a few thing so that we can now use assoc list. along with changing a few if to switch per Rohesie's demand

* change the way temp is modified during the enemy_setup() proc

basically as per Rohesie's request (again) there will be a temporary list that will add whatever it needs during the enemy setup then .Join() the list at the end.

* buff the finishing move

buff the finishing move so that it kills the enemy more reliably

Various gpio and mux settings for the Osprey 440 weren't correct.  Fix them
and provide some documentation about how the gpios work.

The osprey eeprom routine wasn't run for the 440, add it.  It was also crap,
re-written to be better.

Add the Osprey 440 to the Bt878 ALSA driver's whitelist.  Currently the sample
rate is fixed at 32kHz, as the driver doesn't support different rates for
digital input mode, though the card can select the rate from 32, 44.1, or 48
kHz via gpio.

Setting the audio gain via ALSA isn't supported yet; a userspace tool that
programs the X9221 via i2c-dev must be used.

The Bt878 digital audio format isn't programmed correctly for the CS5331A ADC
used, resulting in extremely garbled sound.  That is fixed in a followup
patch.

Cables now autoconnect on cardinal directions. All cable placement has been completely stripped out and replaced with simple single cable per tile logic.
Low effort demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXp8s6ORWbA
Yes I am aware that cutting it is not dropping wire, that version was bugged.
Cables no longer need a knot specifically placed to link to power objects. The sprite is automatically changed to represent this.
The only exception to this logic is that on smes units, due to the terminal being next to the output, they will not link there.
On a technical powernet side, this is the same as old cables once actually placed. They still use the existing powernet system, just the placement and connection works differently.

Old cables have been turned into ""pipe cleaners"" for wire art purposes. they work just like the old ones, just missing all the powernet functionality, and also you can put them on top of the floor.
Why It's Good For The Game

How obnoxious cables were to both map and work with in game has been something that has annoyed me for a really long time now.
This is both easier for new players to learn, and easier for experienced players to work with.
Along with making in game much more intuitive and easier, it makes mapping much easier as well. Mad lad wjohn was able to rip out all the mapping conversion in one day because of how much faster it is to work with.

cl actioninja and wjohn
add: Cables have been completely reworked. Simple per tile connection logic, automatically connects to things above it. Think minecraft redstone.
add: Old cables have been kept as pipe cleaner. They are non-functional in terms of power, but otherwise have the same connection logic. Also can go on top of tiles.
remove: mech cable layer has been removed because it was terrible shitcode nobody used
tweak: (sort of balance) cable stack sized has been reduced to 15.

This is a follow-up to 052cda939b8a5ce1. Expressions like 's.index == 2'
and 's == screen.primary' might work at first. However, they are not
""dynamic"": If screens are added/removed or the primary screen changes,
then the widgets are not updated to follow this.

Instead, the example now uses the new awful.widget.only_on_screen
container which provides the needed dynamic behaviour.

This is arguably ""the real fix"" to #1562 and #1565.

Pull initial ACPI support for arm64 from Will Deacon:
 ""This series introduces preliminary ACPI 5.1 support to the arm64
  kernel using the ""hardware reduced"" profile.  We don't support any
  peripherals yet, so it's fairly limited in scope:

   - MEMORY init (UEFI)

   - ACPI discovery (RSDP via UEFI)

   - CPU init (FADT)

   - GIC init (MADT)

   - SMP boot (MADT + PSCI)

   - ACPI Kconfig options (dependent on EXPERT)

  ACPI for arm64 has been in development for a while now and hardware
  has been available that can boot with either FDT or ACPI tables.  This
  has been made possible by both changes to the ACPI spec to cater for
  ARM-based machines (known as ""hardware-reduced"" in ACPI parlance) but
  also a Linaro-driven effort to get this supported on top of the Linux
  kernel.  This pull request is the result of that work.

  These changes allow us to initialise the CPUs, interrupt controller,
  and timers via ACPI tables, with memory information and cmdline coming
  from EFI.  We don't support a hybrid ACPI/FDT scheme.  Of course,
  there is still plenty of work to do (a serial console would be nice!)
  but I expect that to happen on a per-driver basis after this core
  series has been merged.

  Anyway, the diff stat here is fairly horrible, but splitting this up
  and merging it via all the different subsystems would have been
  extremely painful.  Instead, we've got all the relevant Acks in place
  and I've not seen anything other than trivial (Kconfig) conflicts in
  -next (for completeness, I've included my resolution below).  Nearly
  half of the insertions fall under Documentation/.

  So, we'll see how this goes.  Right now, it all depends on EXPERT and
  I fully expect people to use FDT by default for the immediate future""

Summary:
Usually this seems to imply something terrible has happened on the host
(see cache corruption issues with trying to gunzip 0-size files because
of cache corruption).

I think this is safe to do because the outputStream contains the
serialized Manifest object. The object is not null so we should be able
to guarantee that this file *must* be >0 bytes in size.

Throwing here so that we get logging, and it's okay to fail in this case
beacuse the alternative is uploading a corrupted artifact into the
cache.

  > more wip: - handler now signs you into team so you can see the rest ofapp.   this is badly done, we will rewrite it. - ongoing project: trying to integrate topbar and sidebar.   to do this, i am writing topbar and sidebar so it can use   Routes.ConcourseRoute instead of Location.   I think we have to do this in order to preserve the logical parsing   of the route (which happens at top level) and query params,   which are only used by some apps, including topbar.

This was noticed by anrxc when he set a widget's height to 0.9. These functions
should have caught this invalid height and ignore it, but because they weren't

Another step in moving these APIs toward the common object oriented and
declarative paradigms used by other APIs.

This commit introduces the `awful.keyboard` module. It currenly only
exists as a placeholder for the first few append/remove function, but
will grow in scope in another pull request to expose the currently

Summary:
The +DumpCode attribute is a horrible hack in AMDGPU to embed the
disassembly of the generated code into the elf file. It is used by LLPC
to implement an extension that allows the application to read back the
disassembly of the code.

It tries to print an entry label at the start of every function, but
that didn't work for the first function in the module because
DumpCodeInstEmitter wasn't initialised until EmitFunctionBodyStart
which is too late.

the conclusion is that the only place where the ports are reset to zero,
is from engine->cancel_requests called during i915_gem_set_wedged().

The race is horrible as it results from calling set-wedged on active HW
(the GPU reset failed) and as such we need to be careful as the HW state
changes beneath us. Fortunately, it's the same scary conditions as
affect normal reset, so we can reuse the same machinery to disable state
tracking as we clobber it.

Summary:
This comes with `Implicit Conversion Sanitizer - integer sign change` (D50250):
```
signed char test(unsigned int x) { return x; }
```
`clang++ -fsanitize=implicit-conversion -S -emit-llvm -o - /tmp/test.cpp -O3`
* Old: {F6904292}
* With this patch: {F6904294}

General pattern:
  X & Y

Where `Y` is checking that all the high bits (covered by a mask `4294967168`)
are uniform, i.e.  `%arg & 4294967168`  can be either  `4294967168`  or  `0`
Pattern can be one of:
  %t = add        i32 %arg,    128
  %r = icmp   ult i32 %t,      256
Or
  %t0 = shl       i32 %arg,    24
  %t1 = ashr      i32 %t0,     24
  %r  = icmp  eq  i32 %t1,     %arg
Or
  %t0 = trunc     i32 %arg  to i8
  %t1 = sext      i8  %t0   to i32
  %r  = icmp  eq  i32 %t1,     %arg
This pattern is a signed truncation check.

And `X` is checking that some bit in that same mask is zero.
I.e. can be one of:
  %r = icmp sgt i32   %arg,    -1
Or
  %t = and      i32   %arg,    2147483648
  %r = icmp eq  i32   %t,      0

Since we are checking that all the bits in that mask are the same,
and a particular bit is zero, what we are really checking is that all the
masked bits are zero.
So this should be transformed to:
  %r = icmp ult i32 %arg, 128

The transform itself ended up being rather horrible, even though i omitted some cases.
Surely there is some infrastructure that can help clean this up that i missed?

https://rise4fun.com/Alive/3Ou

The initial commit (rL339610)
was reverted, since the first assert was being triggered.
The @positive_with_extra_and test now has coverage for that case.

It was attempting to load InjectedScript, etc.
with the wrong path and hitting a CHECK().
I moved InjectedScript and DebugScript into
the v8_inspector directory and fixed their loading.

I also broke the dependency from v8_inspector
onto engine/platform by moving the horrible
Platform::loadResource hack out of PlatformImpl
into a new file just for v8_inspector.

In this process I also found some (broken!)
code for showing the broken image icon which
if we ever hit would just have crashed, so
I removed that code as well.

Fixes for 3.20. I did stick the gen3/4 reset work from Ville in because we
have an awful lot of gen4 mesa hangs, and with this reset should also work
on vintage i965g/gm (we already have reset for g4x/gen4.5). So should help
to appease users suffering from these hangs. Otherwise all over.

Clean up some cases where we're dealing with GTT pages instead of
system pages to use I915_GTT_PAGE_SIZE instead of PAGE_SHIT. So
just replace the the shifts with mul/div as appropriate. These
are the easy ones, the rest probably need some actual thought.

No real changes in the generated asm. Only gen8_ppgtt_insert_4lvl()
was affected as gcc decided to do the following change:
-     be9:       89 d9                   mov    %ebx,%ecx
-     beb:       c1 e1 0c                shl    $0xc,%ecx
-     bee:       48 63 c9                movslq %ecx,%rcx
+     be9:       48 63 cb                movslq %ebx,%rcx
+     bec:       48 c1 e1 0c             shl    $0xc,%rcx
and that then shifted a bunch of the offset by one byte. I presume
the sign extensions in the asm are due to integer promotions from
u16 etc. Hopefully someone has confirmed that those don't end up
doing the wrong thing for us.

Discussion
----------

[HttpKernel][MonologBridge] PSR-3 support

This enables PSR-3 support and monolog 1.3+. The first commit is the main part. The rest deals with deprecation of short-hand methods (warn/err/crit/emerg) that are fully expanded in PSR-3 (warning/error/critical/emergency).

The downside of deprecating them is that for bundles it's a bit harder to support older and newer versions. If that is too much of a hassle you can drop that for now and cherry pick the first commit.

The upside is that it forces people to move towards PSR-3 compatible stuff, which means eventually we could completely drop the LoggerInterface from the framework. In any case I think the documentation should only mention the `Psr\Log\LoggerInterface` and people should start hinting against that. The change should be done in core as well I suppose.

Anyway I wanted to throw this out there as it is to get feedback.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2013-01-09T09:15:15Z

@Seldaek I also think you should change the typehint to use the PSR LoggerInterface in all classes using the logger

I'm trying to understand why a `composer update` of a Symfony 2.1.* resulted in a fatal error. Shouldn't a stable version don't break like this?

As @olaurendeau points, why Symfony depends 1.* instead of 1.2.*? Or why Monolog 1.3 breaks its public interface (EDIT: I'm not sure about it)? Or why isn't this PR being merged (into branch 2.1) at the same time Monolog 1.3 is released?

Please, understand I'm not looking for who to blame, it's just I want to know if this situation is unexpected or if otherwise a `composer update` on a stable branch is not as innocent as it seems.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2013-01-10T15:06:51Z

@frosas it cannot be merged into 2.1 as it is a BC break. The 2.1 branch has been updated to forbid Monolog 1.3 already

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Seldaek at 2013-01-10T15:11:58Z

@frosas you can blame me for releasing as 1.3.0 and not 2.0, but technically for monolog this isn't really a BC break, I just added an interface. The problem is due to the way it's used in symfony, it ended up as a fatal error. In any case the situation is now sorted out I think.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by frosas at 2013-01-10T15:26:43Z

@stof now I see this `>=1.0,<1.3-dev` change in the 2.1 branch. Now, shouldn't a new (2.1.7) version be released for all of us not in the dev minimum-stability?

@Seldaek then do you see feasible to rely only in X.Y.* versions to avoid this kind of errors?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Seldaek at 2013-01-10T15:45:22Z

@frosas relying on X.Y.* is painful because you always need to wait until someone updates the constraint to get the new version. Of course using ~1.3 like in this PR means if I fuck up and break BC people will update to it, but that's a less likely occurrence than the alternative I think, so I would rather not use X.Y.*

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by frosas at 2013-01-10T15:50:50Z

@Seldaek you are right about this, but I was thinking more in changing it only for the stable versions. EDIT: I mean, how often do you need a new feature in a branch you only apply fixes to?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2013-01-10T15:57:32Z

@frosas Monolog and Symfony have separate release cycles. Foorcing Symfony users to use an old version of Monolog until they update to a new version of Symfony whereas the newer Monolog is compatible is a bad idea. Thus, as Monolog keeps BC, it does not maintain bugfix releases for all older versions (just like Twig does too). So it would also forbid you to get the fixes done in newer Monolog versions.

The incompatibility between Symfony 2.1 LoggerInterface and PSR-3 (whereas they expect exactly the same behavior and signature for methods with the same name) is unfortunate and is the reason why we get some issues here.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by frosas at 2013-01-10T16:21:06Z

@stof I appreciate you prefer to allow newer versions at the price of having to be constantly monitoring its changes to avoid breaks.

Another similar but safer strategy would be to stick to X.Y.* versions and upgrade to X.Y+1.* once the new version integration is tested, but I understand this is discutible in projects as close to Symfony as Monolog.

Returning to the issue, what do you say to release this 2.1.7 version? Or is it only me who is having issues here?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2013-01-10T16:26:20Z

@frosas a minor release should not break BC when following smeantic versionning (Symfony warned about the fact it is not strictly followed for the first releases of 2.x). But as far as monolog is concerned, 1.3 is BC with 1.2.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library will be used by clang-query. I can imagine LLDB becoming another
client of this library, so I think LLVM is a sensible place for it to live.
It wraps libedit, and adds tab completion support.

The code is loosely based on the line editor bits in LLDB, with a few
improvements:

 - Polymorphism for retrieving the list of tab completions, based on
   the concept pattern from the new pass manager.

 - Tab completion doesn't corrupt terminal output if the input covers
   multiple lines. Unfortunately this can only be done in a truly horrible
   way, as far as I can tell. But since the alternative is to implement our
   own line editor (which I don't think LLVM should be in the business of
   doing, at least for now) I think it may be acceptable.

 - Includes a fallback for the case where the user doesn't have libedit
   installed.

Note that this uses C stdio, mainly because libedit also uses C stdio.

* Unicode support Part 2 -- copytext()

This is the transition of all copytext() calls to be unicode aware and also some nearby calls in the same functions. Most things are just replacing copytext() with copytext_char() as a terrible character limiter but a few others were slightly more involved.

I replaced a ton of
````
var/something = sanitize(input())
something = copytext(something, 1, MAX_MESSAGE_LEN)
````

with a single stripped_input() call. stripped_input() already calls html_encode(), trim(), and some other sanitization so there shouldn't be any major issues there.

This is still VERY rough btw; DNA is a mess, the status displays are complete ass, there's a copytext() in code\datums\shuttles.dm that I'm not sure what to do with, and I didn't touch anything in the tools folder. I haven't tested this much at all yet, I only got it to compile earlier this morning. There's also likely to be weird bugs until I get around to fixing length(), findtext(), and the rest of the string procs.

The solution is explained in the comment in the code.

When RUN ONCE skipped the actual program call, it wasn't
cleaning out the args and KOSArgMarker the program call was
supposed to be popping.  When you use RUN ONCE with a program
that takes no args, that's not horrible, as it just
left one extra KOSArgMarker on the stack which was fine
but slightly wasted stack space if you do RUN ONCE a lot.
But when you use RUN ONCE interleaved with calls to other
programs that DO expect arguments, and start putting the
PARAMETER statement AFTER the RUN ONCE's, then the fact
that this extra KOSArgMarker was there caused misalignment
of the stack.

My solution was that in the clause where RUN ONCE choses to
skip the program call, have the @LR boilerplate program do
the same thing to the stack that a call would have done, that
is have it pop everything down to an including the topmost
KOSArgMarker.  I did that by coding a small kRISC loop there:
like so:

// Keep popping till next thing is argbottom, then pop that too:
pop           <---.
testargbottom     |
br.true ---.      |
jump ------+------'
pop   <----'

Moving events directly to the exec queue instead of the reordering
incoming queue, leaves holes in the sequence, that lead to timeouts for
all other events. Remove that part of the special handling.

(With netlink, events can't get out-of-order and the maximum timeout is 5
seconds and should not cause any trouble with the 10 sec timout for the
firmware class anyway. Events with timeouts are still prioritized for
execution, but don't bypass the incoming queue anymore.)

My test program that simulates a similar sequence, runs without any delay
now. (With one of the next versions we will make netlink mandatory, then
we can remove the whole input queue crap with the reordering anyway.)

Summary:
Rework the GMIR documentation to focus more on the end user than the
implementation and tie it in to the MIR document. There was also some
out-of-date information which has been removed.

The quality of the GenericOpcode reference is highly variable and drops
sharply as I worked through them all but we've got to start somewhere :-).
It would be great if others could expand on this too as there is an awful
lot to get through.

Also fix a typo in the definition of G_FLOG. Previously, the comments said
we had two base-2's (G_FLOG and G_FLOG2).

This commit is a large squash, the full development branch is available at:
https://github.com/cirosantilli/linux-kernel-module-cheat/tree/asm

This notably means a refactor of the userland build and testing, to support:

- improved assembly infrastructure unified across arm and x86
- native in-tree build and test helpers
- parallel building and testing, which implies thread_pool.py
- selection of what to build and test from the CLI
- path_properties.py to indicate how to build and run different examples
- in full system, move all userland stuff into /lkmc
- prefix everything that we defined across files with LKMC
- --gdb uber convenient helper
- remove import imp which was deprecated

Full commit messages from the branch follow:

1:

userland: add assembly support

Move arm assembly cheat here, and start some work on x86 cheat as well.

2:

document userland asm syscall interfaces

3:

userland assembly: structure readme

4:

x86 fail works

5:

asm: more links

6:

userland: add ported to all archs

7:

move all our stuff into /lkmc in guest

Motivation: userland is getting several new subdirectories, it would be
too insane to just dump all of that in the guest root filesystem.

To alleviate the cd pain, .profile puts user inside /lkmc by default.

8:

start the big userland migration

9:

migrate all

10:

bak

11:

build-userland-in-tree is now a Python command

./build calls it, we did this to allow --download-dependencies to work
perfectly.

12:

rename include to lkmc

13:

mtops.h is perfect now

14:

userland: make build perfect

15:

preparing test_user_mode, need to generalize stuff as usual

16:

asm: prefix every linux specific with linux/

17:

userland: maybe it really works

18:

userland: fix kernel version to work on older ubuntu

Expose --kernel-version to allow customization.

Update LTP info.

19:

userland: build really truly working now

userland test: start work, in a working state, but no features

20:

test-user-mode: make perfect like build-userland

Multithreading and target selection.

21:

userland: get a bit closer to perfection

22:

thread_pool: support passing thread IDs

Then use that to fix gem5 error log read race.

23:

userland: native testing

24:

userland: path properties getting nice!

25:

userland: move posix/environ from cpp-cheat

26:

gem5: --debug-flags without =, looks nicer whenever it can be done

27:

run: rename --wait-gdb in --gdb-wait, --gdb prefix might become a thing

28:

run: create --tmux-program gdb to open gem5 GDB

29:

run: create the uber convenient --gdb option

30:

userland: move getchar from cpp-cheat

31:

prebuilt: kernel boot aarch64 does not work on Ubuntu 16.04

32:

userland: x86_64 linux hello world make PIE

33:

userland: try to make userland executable selection saner

Only allow existing files to be built, stop extension expansion madness.

cli_function: get_cli print booleans properly, was printing without --no-
for negations.

34:

userland: only link to lkmc.o if needed

35:

path_properties: make data very compact with only tuples and dicts

Spend 2 hours of my life thinking about low value tree walks ;-)

36:

userland: move more userland/arch/ logic into property tree

37:

userland: make libs work

Working for build, but now test-user-mode-in-tree is not using --in-tree,
TODO fix later on.

38:

userland: make libs really work

39:

userland: document path_properties

40:

userland: classify linux

41:

waste your life

42:

common: fix absolute path runs

--gdb: allow running from arbitrary directory

43:

baremetal: arm allow using floating point instructions

44:

baremetal: stat preparing to make perfect like userland/

45:

run: fix image check logic accounting for userland

Was failing if I try to run userland (with abspath) when out/
directory is not present.

46:

cli-function: raise if the config file is given and does not exist

47:

common: define missing 'ld' variable, this broke m5 build

48:

rum: --qemu-which host now works for user mode as well as system

Don't fall back on host QEMU automatically, too much insanity.

49:

userland: refix silly mistakes

50:

userland: use path_properties flags for all builds, including lkmc. and userland/arch/main.c

Without this in particular, --gdb fails on assembly because main.c
was not being built with -ggdb3.

51:

userland: start refactor to show failing values on failure!

aarch64 basically done, but missing:

- other archs
- maybe convert main.c into C++ to use templates?
- full review of ASSERT_EQ calling convention issues not seen by tests
  by chance
- documentation

52:

readme: releases are more stable...

53:

submodules: sort gitmodules

54:

test-baremetal: same interface as test-user-mode

In particular, runs tests in parallel, and allows selecting given tests

55:

baremetal: allow arbitrary exit status with the magic string

test-baremetal: fix missing setting x0 return value

Examples were just returning on ret without setting x0, which led to
failures... those were not noticed because of how broken the testing system
was ;-)

56:

baremetal: ah, actually nope, it didn't work :-(

Workaround for now. Works on asserts, but not on exit 1.

Some other day, maybe.

https://github.com/cirosantilli/linux-kernel-module-cheat/issues/59

57:

panic on panic: improve behaviour description

58:

baremetal: get exit status working with on_exit :-)

59:

baremetal: implement C assert

60:

test-baremetal: remove commented out exit status workaround

61:

test-user-mode: handle exit status for signals. Fix #61.

62:

aarch64: fix ASSERT_EQ_REG tests on gem5

Was doing an 8-byte aligned store, which gem5 dislikes.

But the ARMARM says bad things may happen there, notably a signal:
""D1.8.2 SP alignment checking"" so gem5 is not really too wrong,
QEMU just happens to work by chance.

63:

userland assembly: build empty.S and fail.S to toplevel and run fail.S with path_properties exit_status

They were just duplicating stuff needlessly while we don't support non-native in-tree builds,
which leads to executable conflicts for C file anyways.

64:

gem5: use a single build tree for all build types

gem5 already has different object names for each build type it seems, so
let's just make sure that works and save some disk space.

65:

userland x86_64: ASSERT_EQ show actual and expected values

66:

assert_fail.c: add to readme index

67:

userland x86_64: implement ASSERT_MEMCMP

68:

userland x86_64: allow ASSERT_EQ to take just about anything

69:

gas data sizes

70:

gas_data_sizes.S: make PIE for all ISAs

71:

x86: paddq

72:

x86 paddq: test entire family

73:

Get rid of imp, started giving deprecation warning every time in Python 3.7 in Ubuntu 19.04.

Please python stop torturing me with refactors.

Make ./run -u blow up if executable not found, otherwise I go crazy.

Get ./test-gdb back to life after the ./run relative path refactor, forgot to test this.

74:

fix run-toolchain, qemu-monitor, trace-boot, trace2line, bisect-linux-boot-gem5. Fixes part of #63

I'm sad no one reported qemu-monitor break, that one is kind of important.

count.out arguments broke it as an init program, since the kernel adds trash
parameters to every init.

Is anyone using this repo, I wonder? Keep pushing, keep pushing.
One day it gets good enough, and the whole world will see.

75:

x86 assembly: addpd

76:

Fix import_path circular dependency by splitting it out.

Use import thread_pool instead from, from is evil.

Fix poweroff.out path for ./trace-boot.

77:

run: rename cryptic tmu to tmux-split, ./run is good now so I never use it anymore explicitly

78:

assembly SIMD add: make uniform for all ISAs, mark as entry point to learning SIMD

79:

start moving arm-assembly-cheat readme in here

80:

arm assembly: move some more in

81:

move more arm in

82:

userland: attempt to fix all assembly example links to README

83:

assembly: improve organization of simd add

84:

ld2 move in

85:

Make userland / assembly getting started more uniform / visible

Forward --gcc-which to ./run --tmux.

Use gdb-multiarch for --gcc-which host.

86:

userland: disable PIE explicitly on command line for all executables

87:

userland: make userland content a better landing page

88:

build: check git version from --version and degrade gracefully

89:

build: make --dry-run work again on all

90:

import_path: importlib explicit for Ubuntu 16.04

91:

make all submodules point to my forks

git servers are insane, submodule implementation is crap, what can you do

92:

build: log warning on git too old for --update

93:

build-linux: do olddefconfig even if no fragments

In particular, gem5 kernel 4.15 needs it

path to an image and tries to load it. So why should we do the work of calling
image() ourselves if it can be done for us? ;)

Summary:
In D1421787, I attempted to publish java.util.logging
messages to BuckEventBus as LogEvents to play nicely with
SuperConsole. After talking with @dreiss, I realized this was
backwards for two reasons:

1) We don't want developer-focused messages appearing on end-user
consoles by default.

2) BuckEventBus is a terrible system to rely on for debug logging
(it's asynchronous and serial, plus it gets clogged up if any handler
takes a long time).

This diff flips D1421787 and D1421821 on their heads by introducing a
new class, LoggingBuildListener, which listens to BuckEventBus and
publishes events to java.util.logging.

Note that I'm a bit of a Guava EventBus n00b, so I couldn't figure
out how to listen for all events plus specialize for some others
without a bunch of 'instanceof' checks. So let me know if
this is goofy.

Test Plan: buck build buck, confirmed debug messages in logs.

querying of the pass registry.

The pass manager relies on the static registry of PassInfo objects to
perform all manner of its functionality. I don't understand why it does
much of this. My very vague understanding is that this registry is
touched both during static initialization *and* while each pass is being
constructed. As a consequence it is hard to make accessing it not
require a acquiring some lock. This lock ends up in the hot path of
setting up, tearing down, and invaliditing analyses in the legacy pass
manager.

On most systems you can observe this as a non-trivial % of the time
spent in 'ninja check-llvm'. However, I haven't really seen it be more
than 1% in extreme cases of compiling more real-world software,
including LTO.

Unfortunately, some of the GPU JITs are seeing this taking essentially
all of their time because they have very small IR running through
a small pass pipeline very many times (at least, this is the vague
understanding I have of it).

This patch tries to minimize the cost of looking up PassInfo objects by
leveraging the fact that the objects themselves are immutable and they
are allocated separately on the heap and so don't have their address
change. It also requires a change I made the last time I tried to debug
this problem which removed the ability to de-register a pass from the
registry. This patch creates a single access path to these objects
inside the PMTopLevelManager which memoizes the result of querying the
registry. This is somewhat gross as I don't really know if
PMTopLevelManager is the *right* place to put it, and I dislike using
a mutable member to memoize things, but it seems to work.

For long-lived pass managers this should completely eliminate
the cost of acquiring locks to look into the pass registry once the
memoized cache is warm. For 'ninja check' I measured about 1.5%
reduction in CPU time and in total time on a machine with 32 hardware
threads. For normal compilation, I don't know how much this will help,
sadly. We will still pay the cost while we populate the memoized cache.
I don't think it will hurt though, and for LTO or compiles with many
small functions it should still be a win. However, for tight loops
around a pass manager with many passes and small modules, this will help
tremendously. On the AArch64 backend I saw nearly 50% reductions in time
to complete 2000 cycles of spinning up and tearing down the pipeline.
Measurements from Owen of an actual long-lived pass manager show more
along the lines of 10% improvements.

Merge futex fixes from Thomas Gleixner:
 ""So with more awake and less futex wreckaged brain, I went through my
  list of points again and came up with the following 4 patches.

  1) Prevent pi requeueing on the same futex

     I kept Kees check for uaddr1 == uaddr2 as a early check for private
     futexes and added a key comparison to both futex_requeue and
     futex_wait_requeue_pi.

     Sebastian, sorry for the confusion yesterday night.  I really
     misunderstood your question.

     You are right the check is pointless for shared futexes where the
     same physical address is mapped to two different virtual addresses.

  2) Sanity check atomic acquisiton in futex_lock_pi_atomic

     That's basically what Darren suggested.

     I just simplified it to use futex_top_waiter() to find kernel
     internal state.  If state is found return -EINVAL and do not bother
     to fix up the user space variable.  It's corrupted already.

  3) Ensure state consistency in futex_unlock_pi

     The code is silly versus the owner died bit.  There is no point to
     preserve it on unlock when the user space thread owns the futex.

     What's worse is that it does not update the user space value when
     the owner died bit is set.  So the kernel itself creates observable
     inconsistency.

     Another ""optimization"" is to retry an atomic unlock.  That's
     pointless as in a sane environment user space would not call into
     that code if it could have unlocked it atomically.  So we always
     check whether there is kernel state around and only if there is
     none, we do the unlock by setting the user space value to 0.

  4) Sanitize lookup_pi_state

     lookup_pi_state is ambigous about TID == 0 in the user space value.

     This can be a valid state even if there is kernel state on this
     uaddr, but we miss a few corner case checks.

     I tried to come up with a smaller solution hacking the checks into
     the current cruft, but it turned out to be ugly as hell and I got
     more confused than I was before.  So I rewrote the sanity checks
     along the state documentation with awful lots of commentry""

ordering.

The fundamental problem that we're hitting here is that the use-def
chain ordering is *itself* not a stable thing to be relying on in the
rewriting for SROA. Further, we use a non-stable sort over the slices to
arrange them based on the section of the alloca they're operating on.
With a debugging STL implementation (or different implementations in
stage2 and stage3) this can cause stage2 != stage3.

The specific aspect of this problem fixed in this commit deals with the
rewriting and load-speculation around PHIs and Selects. This, like many
other aspects of the use-rewriting in SROA, is really part of the
""strong SSA-formation"" that is doen by SROA where it works very hard to
canonicalize loads and stores in *just* the right way to satisfy the
needs of mem2reg[1]. When we have a select (or a PHI) with 2 uses of the
same alloca, we test that loads downstream of the select are
speculatable around it twice. If only one of the operands to the select
needs to be rewritten, then if we get lucky we rewrite that one first
and the select is immediately speculatable. This can cause the order of
operand visitation, and thus the order of slices to be rewritten, to
change an alloca from promotable to non-promotable and vice versa.

The fix is to defer all of the speculation until *after* the rewrite
phase is done. Once we've rewritten everything, we can accurately test
for whether speculation will work (once, instead of twice!) and the
order ceases to matter.

This also happens to simplify the other subtlety of speculation -- we
need to *not* speculate anything unless the result of speculating will
make the alloca fully promotable by mem2reg. I had a previous attempt at
simplifying this, but it was still pretty horrible.

There is actually already a *really* nice test case for this in
basictest.ll, but on multiple STL implementations and inputs, we just
got ""lucky"". Fortunately, the test case is very small and we can
essentially build it in exactly the opposite way to get reasonable
coverage in both directions even from normal STL implementations.

Yet another story of games loading weird shit into registers.

For some reason, Burnout 2 would (in rare situations) load invalid
addresses into cp_state.array_bases. What would the real hardware
do in this situation? Who knows, Burnout 2 doesn't actually enable
the vertex array with the invalid address so nothing kinky happens.

But dolphin tries to optimise things and starts using the address
as soon as it is loaded into memory. This causes GetPointer (which is
now much more vocal) to throw an error.

The Fix:  We don't call GetPointer until we are sure the vertex array
has been enabled.

The Microsoft Surface Type/Touch Cover 2 is a fancy device which advertised
itself as a multitouch device but with constant input reports.
This way, hid_scan_report() gives the group MULTITOUCH to it, but
hid-multitouch can not handle it due to the constant collection ignored
by hid-input.

To prevent such crap in the future, and while we do not fix this particular
device, make the scan_report coherent with hid-input.c, and ignore constant
input reports.

In this case, instcombine was able to eliminate the nonsense, but in PR8980 enough
PHIs are in play that instcombine backs off.  It's better to not generate this stuff
in the first place.

one pesky test case correctly.

This test case caused the old code to infloop occilating between solving
the low-half and the high-half. The 'side balancing' part of
single-input v8 shuffle lowering didn't handle the one pattern which can
cause it to occilate. Fortunately the fuzz testing found this case.
Unfortuately it was *terrible* to handle. I'm really sorry for the
amount and density of the code here, I'd love suggestions on how to
simplify it. I feel like there *must* be a simpler form here, but after
a lot of days I've not found it. This is the only one I've found that
even works. I've added the one pesky test case along with some nice
comments explaining the core problem that we have to solve here.

So far this has survived approximately 32k test cases. More strenuous
fuzzing commencing.

----------
We explode a lot of temp files from within uberjars. We shouldn't do that
because it wastes space and time.

Modifications
-------------
* Add an uberjar:// URL handler, get it registered with the jboss-modules
  modular URL stream factory.
* Adjust our usage of MavenResolvers to a possibly-stream-based ArtifactResolver
* Still wrap our new ArtifactResolvers into a JBoss-Modules happy file-based
  MavenResolver.
* Monkey-patch the jboss-modules MavenArtifactUtils to not insist on files
  being on disk.
* Iff possible, stream any jars-within-uberjars into JBoss-Module ClassSpec
  byte[] arrays directly in-memory, instead of copying them out of the
  uberjar onto the filesystem.
* But don't do it for org.wildfly.swarm:* artifacts, which are bean archives,
  because uberjar:// annoys the crap out of Weld (Hi Martin).

The MemberAction hook, which parses the URL to find out if there is
anything beyond the resource identifier which might be interpreted as
an action to execute is an abomination and a horrible hack.
This patch does some justice by casting it into the abyss of git
history, hopefully forever.

As a matter of fact, the only Neutron API resource that uses this
capability is the router, with the actions 'add_router_interface' and
'remove_reouter_interface'. Therefore, not without a good deal of
deliberate opinionated thinking, this patch adds a specialiized Pecan
controller for the router resource rather than adding the abiity to
handle member actions in the generic resource controller.
The main driver behind this decision is that ""member actions"" should
be avoided as much as possile, and there is not yet an agreed-upon API
guideline on how they should be expressed in OpenStack APIs.

The 'router' extension (neutron/extensions/l3.py) has also been
""pecanized"", by returning a RouterController for routers and an
instance of the generic ItemController for floating IPs.

Moreover, references to the 'member_action' parameter in the request
context are removed. The BodyValidation hook has been updated to
process the request body only if a resource or collection name can be
found in it (member actions don't have any according to the Neutron
API specification).

Finally, this patch adds functional tests specific for validating
member action processing in the router controller.

Using the extracted INSTDONE reading, and our new register definitions,
update our hangcheck detection and error collection to use it. This
primarily means changing == to memcmp, and changing = to memcpy.
Hopefully this will give more info on error dump, and provide more
accurate hangcheck detection (both are actually TBD).

Also, remove the reading of instdone1 from the ring error collection
function, and just crap everything in capture_error_state (that could be
split into a separate patch if it wasn't so trivial).

code a bit (Jani)

v3: use ARRAY_SIZE as requested earlier by Jani (didn't change sizeof)

The joys of copy/paste: the example of a virtualization capable GIC
in the DT binding was wrong, and propagated to dozens of platforms.
By having a GICC region that is only 4kB (instead of 8kB), we
end-up not being able to access the GICC_DIR register which is on
the second page.

Oh well. Let's fix the source of the crap before tackling individual
offenders.

Starting with 1.7.0_06 [1], String.substring no longer reuses the internal
char array of the String but make a copy instead. Since we call
subSequence twice for *every* input character, this results in horrible
parse performance and GC.

This patch teaches the caching MemorySSA walker a few things:

1. Not to walk Phis we've walked before. It seems that we tried to do
   this before, but it didn't work so well in cases like:

define void @foo() {
  %1 = alloca i8
  %2 = alloca i8
  br label %begin

begin:
  ; 3 = MemoryPhi({%0,liveOnEntry},{%end,2})
  ; 1 = MemoryDef(3)
  store i8 0, i8* %2
  br label %end

end:
  ; MemoryUse(?)
  load i8, i8* %1
  ; 2 = MemoryDef(1)
  store i8 0, i8* %2
  br label %begin
}

Because we wouldn't put Phis in Q.Visited until we tried to visit them.
So, when trying to optimize MemoryUse(?):
  - We would visit 3 above
    - ...Which would make us put {%0,liveOnEntry} in Q.Visited
    - ...Which would make us visit {%0,liveOnEntry}
    - ...Which would make us put {%end,2} in Q.Visited
    - ...Which would make us visit {%end,2}
      - ...Which would make us visit 3
        - ...Which would realize we've already visited everything in 3
        - ...Which would make us conservatively return 3.

In the added test-case, (@looped_visitedonlyonce) this behavior would
cause us to give incorrect results. Specifically, we'd visit 4 twice
in the same query, but on the second visit, we'd skip while.cond because
it had been visited, visit if.then/if.then2, and cache ""1"" as the
clobbering def on the way back.

2. If we try to walk the defs of a {Phi,MemLoc} and see it has been
   visited before, just hand back the Phi we're trying to optimize.

I promise this isn't as terrible as it seems. :)

We now insert {Phi,MemLoc} pairs just before walking the Phi's upward
defs. So, we check the cache for the {Phi,MemLoc} pair before checking
if we've already walked the Phi.

The {Phi,MemLoc} pair is (almost?) always guaranteed to have a cache
entry if we've already fully walked it, because we cache as we go.

So, if the {Phi,MemLoc} pair isn't in cache, either:
 (a) we must be in the process of visiting it (in which case, we can't
     give a better answer in a cache-as-we-go DFS walker)

 (b) we visited it, but didn't cache it on the way back (...which seems
     to require `ModifyingAccess` to not dominate `StartingAccess`,
     so I'm 99% sure that would be an error. If it's not an error, I
     haven't been able to get it to happen locally, so I suspect it's
     rare.)

- - - - -

As a consequence of this change, we no longer skip upward defs of phis,
so we can kill the `VisitedOnlyOne` check. This gives us better accuracy

Right now the ""check"" step builds LLVM, Clang, and LLD, which is an
awful lot of compilation to do during a testing step. Doing that work up
front will make it obvious if there's a compilation issue in Clang or
LLD without having to click through to the testing logs.

Mark found ldsem_cmpxchg() needed an (atomic_long_t *) cast to keep
working after making the atomic_long interface type safe.

Needing casts is bad form, which made me look at the code. There are no
ld_semaphore::count users outside of these functions so there is no
reason why it can not be an atomic_long_t in the first place, obviating
the need for this cast.

That also ensures the loads use atomic_long_read(), which implies (at
least) READ_ONCE() in order to guarantee single-copy-atomic loads.

When using atomic_long_try_cmpxchg() the ldsem_cmpxchg() wrapper gets
very thin (the only difference is not changing *old on success, which
most callers don't seem to care about).

So rework the whole thing to use atomic_long_t and its accessors
directly.

While there, fixup all the horrible comment styles.

According to our FIPS CAVS testing lab guru, when we're in fips mode,
we must print out notices of successful self-test completion for
every alg to be compliant.

New and improved v2, without strncmp crap. Doesn't need to touch a flag
though, due to not moving the notest label around anymore.

Applies atop '[PATCH v2] crypto: catch base cipher self-test failures

Personally, I wouldn't mind seeing this info printed out regardless of
whether or not we're in fips mode, I think its useful info, but will
stick with only in fips mode for now.

- It is possible in principle to call error() with a non-string value, so errhand should sanitize its values with tostring.

- There is a check in the main boot.lua loop whether xpcall returned a string, which is the sign luajit hit an error in an error handler. This check was occurring in the wrong place (my fault; merge error when preparing PR) so if lovr.load() hit this case we were falling back to the horrible “could not call a string” error.

Since we only access reiserfs_key ->u.k_offset_v2 guts in four helper
functions, we are free to sanitize those, as long as

- layout of the structure is unchanged (it's on-disk object)

- behaviour of these helpers is same as before.

Patch kills the mess with endianness-dependent bitfields and replaces them
with a single __le64.  Helpers are switched to straightforward shift/and/or.

Benefits:

- exact same definitions for little- and big-endian architectures; no ifdefs
  in sight.

- generate the same code on little-endian and improved on big-endian.

- doesn't rely on lousy bitfields handling in gcc codegenerator.

- happens to be standard C (unsigned long long is not a valid type for a
  bitfield; it's a gccism and not well-implemented one, at that).

* RFC Add warning for rendering into container that was updated manually

RFC because we still need to tidy this up and verify that all tests
pass.

**what is the change?:**
We want to warn when users render into a container which was manually
emptied or updated outside of React. This can lead to the cryptic error
about not being able to remove a node, or just lead to silent failures
of render. This warning should make things more clear.

Note that this covers the case where the contents of the root container
are manually updated, but does not cover the case where something was
manually updated deeper in the tree.

**why make this change?:**
To maintain parity and increase clarity before releasing v16.0 beta.

**test plan:**
`yarn test`

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8854

last item under the '16 beta' checklist.

* Add test and tweak check for rendering into manually updated container

STILL TODO: figure out how to skip this warning when the component
renders to a portal.

Unfortunately 'ReactPortal.isPortal(children)' returns false, even in
the failing test where we are rendering to a portal.

**what is the change?:**
- added a test for the case where we call 'ReactDOM.render' with a new
  container, using a key or a different type, after the contents of the
  first container were messed with outside of React. This case throws,
  and now at least there will be an informative warning along with the
  error.
- We updated the check to compare the parent of the 'hostInstance' to
  the container; this seems less fragile
- tweaked some comments

**why make this change?:**
Continue improving this to make it more final.

**test plan:**
`yarn test`

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8854

* Stub our `console.error` in one of the portal tests

**what is the change?:**
See title

**why make this change?:**
See comment in the code

**test plan:**
`yarn test`

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8854

* Skip warning in 'ReactDOMFiberEntry' when mounting to Comment node

**what is the change?:**
We have a warning for cases when the container doesn't match the parent
which we remembered the previously rendered content being rendered into.

We are skipping that warning when you render into a 'comment' node.

**why make this change?:**
Basically, if you render into a 'comment' node, then the parent of the
comment node is the container for your rendered content. We could check
for similarity there but rendering into a comment node seems like a
corner case and I'd rather skip the warning without knowing more about
what could happen in that case.

**test plan:**
`yarn test`

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8854

* Improve warning message, remove dedup check, and unmock console.error

**what is the change?:**
Various changes to get this closer to being finished;
- Improved warning message (thanks @spicyj!!!)
- Removed dedup check on warning
- Remove mocking of 'console.error' in portals test

**why make this change?:**
- warning message improvement: communicates better with users
- Remove dedup check: it wasn't important in this case
- Remove mocking of 'console.error'; we don't want to ignore an
  inaccurate warning, even for an ""unstable"" feature.

**test plan:**
`yarn test` -> follow-up commits will fix the remaining tests

**issue:**
issue #8854

* Possible fix for issue of incorrect warning for portal re-render

**what is the change?:**
Add a property to a container which was rendered into using
`ReactDOM.unstable_createPortal`.

**why make this change?:**
We don't want to warn for mismatching container nodes in this case - the
user intentionally rendered into the portal container instead of the
original container.

concerns;
- will this affect React Native badly?
- will this add bloat to the portal code? seems small enough but not
  sure.

**test plan:**
`yarn test`

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8854

* Fix logic for checking if the host instance container is a portal

**what is the change?:**
When focusing on fixing the warning to not check when we are using
portals, I missed checking for the existence of the host instance parent
before checking if it was a portal. This adds the missing null checks.

**why make this change?:**
To fix a bug that the previous commit introduced.

**test plan:**
`yarn test`
-> follow-up commits fix more of the test failures

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8854

* Clean up new tests in ReactDOMFiber-test

**what is the change?:**
- removed extra single quotes, downgrade double quotes to single
- update expected warning message to match latest warning message
- fix indentation

**why make this change?:**
- get tests passing
- code maintainability/readability

**test plan:**
`yarn test`
follow up commits will fix the remaining tests

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8854

* Add 'unmountComponentAtNode' call in test for reconciling pre-rendered markup

**what is the change?:**
We have a test that verifies React can reconcile text from pre-rendered
mark-up. It tests React doing this for three strings and three empty
strings.

This adds a call to 'unmountComponentAtNode' between the two
expectations for strings and empty strings.

**why make this change?:**
We now warn when someone messes with the DOM inside of a node in such a
way that removes the React-rendered content. This test was doing that. I
can't think of a situation where this would happen with server-side
rendering without the need to call 'unmountComponentAtNode' before
inserting the server-side rendered content.

**test plan:**
`yarn test`

Only one more failing test, will fix that in the next commit.

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8854

* ran prettier

* remove unused variable

* run scripts/fiber/record-tests

* Fix type error and improve name of portal container flag

**NOTE:** I am still looking for a good place to move this flag
assignment to, or a better approach. This does some intermediate fixes.

**what is the change?:**
- fixed flow error by allowing optional flag on a DOMContainer that
  indicates it was used as a portal container.
- renamed the flag to something which makes more sense

**why make this change?:**
- get Flow passing
- make this change make more sense

We are still not sure about adding this flag; a follow-up diff may move
it or take a different approach.

**test plan:**
`yarn test`

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8854

* Add flag to portalContainer on mount instead of in `createPortal`

**what is the change?:**
We add a flag to the container of a 'portal' in the 'commit work' phase
in Fiber. This is right before we call `appendChildToContainer`.

**why make this change?:**
- Sometimes people call `ReactDOM.render(... container)`, then manually
clear the content of the `container`, and then try to call another
`ReactDOM.render(... container)`.
- This leads to cryptic errors or silent failure because we hold a
  reference to the node that was rendered the first time, and expect it
  to still be inside the container.
- We added a warning for this issue in `renderSubtreeIntoContainer`, but
  when a component renders something returned by
  `ReactDOM.unstable_createPortal(<Component />, portalContainer);`,
  then the child is inside the `portalContainer` and not the `container,
  but that is valid and we want to skip warning in that case.

Inside `renderSubtreeIntoContainer` we don't have the info to determine
if a child was rendered into a `portalContainer` or a `container`, and
adding this flag lets us figure that out and skip the warning.

We originally added the flag in the call to
`ReactDOM.unstable_createPortal` but that seemed like a method that
should be ""pure"" and free of side-effects. This commit moves the
flag-adding to happen when we mount the portal component.

**test plan:**
`yarn test`

https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8854

* Force an 'any' type for the `hostInstance.parentNode` in warning check

**what is the change?:**
This is awful. :(
I'm not sure how else to let Flow know that we expect that this might be
a sort of `DOMContainer` type and not just a normal `Node` type.

To at least make the type information clear we added a comment.

**why make this change?:**
To get `flow` passing. Looks like we have `any` types sprinkled
throughout this file. phooey. :(

**test plan:**
`yarn flow`

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8854

* Ignore portals in `DOMRenderer.findHostInstance`

**what is the change?:**
We want to ignore portals when firing a certain warning.

This allows us to get the host instance and ignore portals.

Also added a new snapshot recording while fixing things.

**why make this change?:**
Originally we had added a flag to the DOM node which was used for

rendering the portal, and then could notice and ignore children rendered
into those nodes.

However, it's better to just ignore portals in
`DOMRenderer.findHostInstance` because
 - we will not ignore a non-portal second child with this approach
 - we meant to ignore portals in this method anyway (according to a
   'TODO' comment)
 - this change only affects the DOM renderer, instead of changing code
   which is shared with RN and other renderers
 - we avoid adding unneeded expandos

**test plan:**
`yarn test`

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8854

* Ran prettier

* Remove error snapshot test

I think there is a bug where an empty snapshot is treated as an 'outdated snapshot'.

If I delete the obsolute snapshot, and run ReactDOMFiber-test.js it generates a new snapshot.
But then when I run the test with the newly generated snapshot, it says ""1 obsolete snapshot found"",
At some point I will file an issue with Jest. For now going to skip the snapshot generation for the error message in the new test.

* Remove expando that we were adding to portal container

**what is the change?:**
see title

**why make this change?:**
this is part of an old approach to detecting portals, and we have
instead added a check in the `findHostInstance` method to filter out
portals.

**test plan:**
`yarn test`

**issue:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8854

* Fork `findHostInstance` to make `findHostInstanceWithNoPortals`

**what is the change?:**
We need to get host instances, but filter out portals. There is not
currently a method for that.

**why make this change?:**
Rather than change the existing `findHostInstance` method, which would
affect the behavior of the public `findDOMNode` method, we are forking.

**test plan:**
`yarn test`

In selinux_ip_output() we always label packets based on the parent
socket.  While this approach works in almost all cases, it doesn't
work in the case of TCP SYN-ACK packets when the correct label is not
the label of the parent socket, but rather the label of the larval
socket represented by the request_sock struct.

Unfortunately, since the request_sock isn't queued on the parent
socket until *after* the SYN-ACK packet is sent, we can't lookup the
request_sock to determine the correct label for the packet; at this
point in time the best we can do is simply pass/NF_ACCEPT the packet.
It must be said that simply passing the packet without any explicit
labeling action, while far from ideal, is not terrible as the SYN-ACK
packet will inherit any IP option based labeling from the initial
connection request so the label *should* be correct and all our
access controls remain in place so we shouldn't have to worry about
information leaks.

Fix a number of bugs reported for JSX indentation (caused by poor JSX
detection):

https://github.com/mooz/js2-mode/issues/451

Potentially manifest some new bugs (due to false positives with ‘<’
and ‘>’ and SGML detection).  Slow down indentation a fair bit.

* list/progmodes/js.el (js-jsx-syntax, js--jsx-start-tag-re)
(js--looking-at-jsx-start-tag-p, js--looking-back-at-jsx-end-tag-p):
New variables and functions.
(js--jsx-find-before-tag, js--jsx-after-tag-re): Deleted.

(js--looking-at-operator-p): Don’t mistake a JSXOpeningElement for the
‘<’ operator.
(js--continued-expression-p): Don’t mistake a JSXClosingElement as a
fragment of a continued expression including the ‘>’ operator.

(js--as-sgml): Simplify.  Probably needn’t bind forward-sexp-function
to nil (sgml-mode already does) and probably shouldn’t bind
parse-sexp-lookup-properties to nil either (see Bug#24896).

(js--outermost-enclosing-jsx-tag-pos): Find enclosing JSX more
accurately than js--jsx-find-before-tag.  Use sgml-mode’s parsing
logic, rather than unreliable heuristics like paren-wrapping.  This
implementation is much slower; the previous implementation was fast,
but at the expense of accuracy.  To make up for all the grief we’ve
caused users, we will prefer accuracy over speed from now on.  That
said, this can still probably be optimized a lot.

(js--jsx-indented-element-p): Rename to js--jsx-indentation, since it
doesn’t just return a boolean.
(js--jsx-indentation): Refactor js--jsx-indented-element-p to simplify
the implementation as the improved accuracy of other code allows (and
to repent for some awful stylistic choices I made earlier).

(js--expression-in-sgml-indent-line): Rename to
js--indent-line-in-jsx-expression, since it’s a private function and
we can give it a name that reads more like English.
(js--indent-line-in-jsx-expression): Restructure point adjustment
logic more like js-indent-line.

(js--indent-n+1th-jsx-line): New function to complement
js--indent-line-in-jsx-expression.

(js-jsx-indent-line): Refactor.  Don’t bind js--continued-expression-p
to ignore any more; instead, rely on the improved accuracy of
js--continued-expression-p.

(js-jsx-mode): Set js-jsx-syntax to t.  For now, this will be the flag
we use to determine whether ‘JSX is enabled.’  (Maybe later, we will
refactor the code to use this variable instead of requiring
js-jsx-mode to be enabled, thus rendering the mode obsolete.)

	The history of that stuff is often amusing.  E.g. for net/core/sock.c
the story looks so, as far as I've been able to reconstruct it: we used to
need major.h in net/socket.c circa 1.1.early.  In 1.1.13 that need had
disappeared, along with register_chrdev(SOCKET_MAJOR, ""socket"", &net_fops)

While I was looking to implement Upgrader as a worker, I realized that there
was a lot of bits necessary to implement a Worker. You have to integrate with a tomb, and monitor the worker, and handle a modest interface, etc. It isn't a terrible amount, but it turns out to be a lot of boilerplate that actually takes a lot if you want to test all the edge cases.

This patch pulls all of that edge-case logic into a NotifyWorker helper.
Essentially you implement a smaller api (WatchHandler), and hand that to the
NotifyWorker. It then handles all the logic about shutting down cleanly, and
you just integrate your couple of actions based on triggers.

I have a follow up patch so you can see what the Cleaner worker looks like with this change.

Probably the biggest advantage of this patch is that I have a very well tested edge-case-handling code, which can now just be re-used for all the other workers, and you don't have to worry about if your code is stopping the watcher it started, or if it is shutting down at the right time, etc.

Maybe there is some way for libxml2 to handle concatenated xml files
(start again on errors), but I don't know it yet.

I need to get stinking drunk before I look at more xml mess.

I'm fucking sick and tired of this shit where people touch code they don't understand.

By adding the comment, you imply that every bit of code thats the same without the same comment is safe to change, but thats not true.

These landmines are important for teaching new coders not to fuck with shit they don't understand.

When you see something and go ""why is it doing it that way"". the answer is not to go ""fuck it, it seems to still work when i change it"" the answer is to leave it the fuck alone until it doing it that way is actually an issue.

It's a terrible user experience to force people building 32-bit
applications on 64-bit Windows to use a cross-info file when every other
tool treats it as a 'native' compilation -- it satisfies all the
requirements for a native compile.

This commit also fixes the platform detection on Windows which would
cause the 'native cpu' to be detected as 32-bit if you installed 32-bit
Python on 64-bit Windows, or if you were building with a 32-bit
toolchain on 64-bit Windows.

Doesn't support MinGW yet -- the next commits will add that since the
changes required for that are more involved.

Abusing irq stats in a driver for counting interrupts is a horrible
idea and not safe with shared interrupts. Replace it by a local
interrupt counter.

* Update binsearch.py

* Added binsearch snatching result using the post.

* Fix daily search

* Patched download_file to also support the method POST.
* Cleaned up binsearch.py.

Unfortunately couldn't test binsearch as the service is down.

* Fixed import.

* Added sending binseach nzb data to sabnzbd using post multipart/form.

* Check if the nzb downloaded from binsearch is correct, before sending it to sab.
* Added docstrings for the methods.
* Added download_nzb_for_post to nzb_provider.py, with a NotImplement exception.
* Sanitize nzb name before sending it to nzb client.

Added tests for a number of binsearch title cleanups.

* Flakes.

* Moved the download_nzb_for_post download logic to snatch_selection in core.py
* reused the SearchResult attributes extra_info and result_type. A result type of 'nzbdata' will make sab and nzbget send the nzbdata instead of the url.

Rails.autoloader and Rails.once_autoloader was just tentative API good
enough for a first patch. Rails.autoloader is singular and does not
convey in its name that there is another autoloader. That might be
confusing, for example if you set a logger and miss traces. On the other
hand, the name `once_autoloader` is very close to being horrible.

Rails.autoloaders.main and Rails.autoloaders.once read better for my
taste, and have a nice symmetry. Also, both ""main"" and ""once"" are four
letters long, short and same length.

They are tagged as ""rails.main"" and ""rails.once"", respectively.

- The current definitions for numbers work great for
unification, but are horrible for subsumption.
This especially breaks down when reasoning over types
and optimizing representations. The crux is `decimal`
integer literals being both float and int. The main change
is that these are now only always integers.
In practice this is cumbersome, so users will more likely
want to use `number` rather than `float`.

- As a result, the meaning of % makes little sense.
  We remove it for now at least.

- Also to aleviate subsumption issue, keeping lists open in
binary operation was somewhat unusual, as operations
require picking a default, which closes it usually.

If you build libvirt with the --no-git option, then gnulib requires
either $GNULIB_SRCDIR in the environment or --gnulib-srcdir on the
command line.  But we had not been supporting its use from the
command line.  This patch is a bit picky: --gnulib-srcdir must be
passed immediately after --no-git; but since we don't reorder
arguments, and since we already required --no-git to be first to
have any effect, it's not too horrible.  It also does the wrong
thing if you include spaces in your arguments, but developers
doing that deserve what they get, right?

Fairly major tidy up of the hierarchy as well. There's now a trivial
base class: InputDevice which simply permits reading of state.
WaitableInputDevice descends from this and introduces waitable events
and callbacks, and provides a hook for calling them but needs further
machinery to activate that hook.

DigitalInputDevice (crap name?) descends from WaitableInputDevice and
uses the standard RPi.GPIO callback mechanisms to handle events. This is
intended for use with trivial on/off devices with predictably small
bounce times.

Next is SmoothedInputDevice (crap name?) which also descends from
WaitableInputDevice. This includes a background threaded queue which
constantly monitors the state of the device and provides a running mean
of its state. This is compared to a threshold for determining active /
inactive state. This is intended for use with on/off devices that
""jitter"" a lot and for which a running average is therefore appropriate
or for devices which provide an effectively analog readout (like
charging capacitor timings).

MonitorSensor and LightSensor now descend from SmoothedInputDevice, and
Button descends from DigitalInputDevice. All ""concrete"" classes provide
event aliases appropriate to their function (e.g. when_dark,
when_pressed, etc.)

This was mistakenly committed. The world isn't ready for this test, the
test code has horrible debugging code in it that should never have
landed in tree, it currently passes because of bugs elsewhere, and it
needs to be rewritten to not be susceptible to passing for the wrong
reasons.

I'll re-land this in a better form when the prerequisite patches land.

So sorry that I got this mixed into a series of commits that *were*
ready to land. I shouldn't have. =[ What's worse is that it stuck around
for so long and I discovered it while fixing the underlying bug that
caused it to pass.

Summary:
Paypal doesn't let us capture cards in a PCI-free way like Stripe and Balanced do, but we can provide a ""pay with paypal"" option at checkout. (For subscriptions, we'll have to invoice monthly to retain control over billing, but this doesn't seem wildly unreasonable.) The bitcoin provider MtGox works in a similar way, as do some other providers we might some day want to implement.

This adds:

  - Hooks to providers so they can offer ""pay once at checkout"" workflows.
  - Hooks so providers can have controllers, for redirect-based third-party workflows.
  - Basic Paypal integration using the ""Express Checkout Merchant API"", which seems like the best fit for our use case. This only goes as far as shoving the user through the payment flow; we don't actually capture payments yet (paypal has around 35 different APIs, but this one seems to be the only PCI-free one which wouldn't give users an awful experience).

This diff is fairly checkpointey, but Phortune doesn't really bill anything yet anyway. Ref T2787.

Test Plan: Ran through Paypal sandbox workflow; ""paid"" for stuff.

    Nuke ES_CLASSPATH appending

    Out of box, ES expects its stuff to be in particular places. We should not be appending to ES_CLASSPATH, allowing users to specify stuff there, like we do in elasticsearch.bin.sh

    If the user sets it, its not going to work out of box.

    Fail hard on empty classpath elements.

    This can happen easily, if somehow old 1.x shellscripts survive and try to launch 2.x code.
    I have the feeling this happens maybe because of packaging upgrades or something.
    Either way: we can just fail hard and clear in this situation, rather than the current situation
    where CWD might be /, and we might traverse the entire filesystem until we hit an error...

It is not safe to to place struct pernet_operations in a special section.
We need struct pernet_operations to last until we call unregister_pernet_subsys.
Which doesn't happen until module unload.

So marking struct pernet_operations is a disaster for modules in two ways.
- We discard it before we call the exit method it points to.
- Because I keep struct pernet_operations on a linked list discarding
  it for compiled in code removes elements in the middle of a linked
  list and does horrible things for linked insert.

So this looks safe assuming __exit_refok is not discarded
for modules.

TCP peformance with TSO over networks with delay is awful.
On a 100Mbit link with 150ms delay, we get 4Mbits/sec with TSO and
50Mbits/sec without TSO.

The problem is with TSO, we intentionally do not keep the maximum
number of packets in flight to fill the window, we hold out to until 
we can send a MSS chunk. But, we also don't update the congestion window 
unless we have filled, as per RFC2861.

This patch replaces the check for the congestion window being full
with something smarter that accounts for TSO.

Summary:
In certain cases vector can use memcpy to construct a range of elements at the back of the vector. We currently don't do this resulting in terrible code gen in non-optimized mode and a
very large slowdown compared to libstdc++. 

This patch adds a `__construct_forward_range(Allocator, Iter, Iter, _Ptr&)` and `__construct_forward_range(Allocator, Tp*, Tp*, Tp*&)` functions to `allocator_traits` which act similarly to the existing `__construct_forward(...)` functions.

This patch also changes vectors `__construct_at_end(Iter, Iter)` to be `__construct_at_end(Iter, Iter, SizeType)` where SizeType is the size of the range. `__construct_at_end(Iter, Iter, SizeType)` now calls `allocator_traits<Tp>::__construct_forward_range(...)`. 

This patch is based off the design of `__swap_out_circular_buffer(...)` which uses `allocator_traits<Tp>::__construct_forward(...)`.

On my machine this code performs 4x better than the current implementation when tested against `std::vector<int>`.

* Turning off PANIC SYPHON now sets scrubbers to scrubbing (default) instead of off.
* Instead of the stupid timeout and VENT NOT FOUND HURRDURR they will just get removed from the list. They were clogging that vent list up as fuck
* Vents pressure settings now have an extra href which resets the vent to ONE_ATMOSPHERE kPa (101.32 or whatever it is)

- The ""Outlet position is obstructed"" error message when opening exofab now only appears if the turf to south is obstructed, not to east like before.

- AI Modules use attack_self instead of attack_hand

- Fixed chatspam with reverse() and made the explode function use the builtin ss13 one instead of my custom, it proved to be faster.

- Added my self to the changelog, because I can!

Instead of using the DTV properties cache directly, pass the get
frontend data as an argument. For now, everything should remain
the same, but the next patch will prevent get_frontend to
affect the global cache.

This is needed because several drivers don't care enough to only
change the properties if locked. Due to that, calling
G_PROPERTY before locking on those drivers will make them to
never lock. Ok, those drivers are crap and should never be
merged like that, but the core should not rely that the drivers
would be doing the right thing.

I'm about to introduce impl.Unquote, which has to be a subtype of all tree nodes.
However unpleasant the consequences are, we have to deal with them, because
we currently don't know of an alternative technology to implement quasiquotes
in a principled manner.

What we discussed with Denys is that we might be able to get back the
guarantees offered by sealedness if we find a way to customize exhaustivity
checks in the pattern matcher from a compiler plugin. People are going to
use scalahost anyway, so it could also do additional domain-specific
exhaustivity checking.

This commit also comes with some refactoring of the adt/ast infrastructure.
In particular, all checks now return q""()"" instead of q"""", which has uncovered
a terrible bug. If a trait def has the INTERFACE flag set, then essentially
any statement in its body (e.g. q""()"") is going to crash the compiler.
Therefore, I'm manually resetting the INTERFACE flag in @root and @branch.
This, in turn, led to problems with `@branch trait Defn`, because it makes
scalac emit `Defn$class`, which comes in conflict with `Defn$Class`.
To address that, I had to temporarily disable all checks for Defn.

When listing projects in the ""Visible To"" selector control:

  - Instead of showing every project you are a member of, show only a few.
  - Add an option to choose something else which isn't in the menu.
  - If you've used the control before, show the stuff you've selected in the recent past.
  - If you haven't used the control before or haven't used it much, show the stuff you've picked and them some filler.
  - Don't offer milestones.
  - Also don't offer milestones in the custom policy UI.

Test Plan:

  - Used ""find"" to select a different project.
  - Saw reasonable defaults.
  - Saw favorites stick.

still makes for a somewhat unpleasant experience.

2.	Even then some ancient creaking piles of crap don't support

The cases it fixes are obscure and the risk of side effects is slight
but possible. This also moves us slightly closer to supporting original
MFM/RLL disks with libata.

MRI 1.9.2 is really. fucking. slow.

It's so slow, in fact, that running the entire Bundler test suite frequently
takes more than 25 minutes, at which point Travis times out the build. The
test suite itself is not actually that slow, running in 8 minutes on 1.8.7
and 7 minutes on 2.0.0-preview2. To work around this, we no longer build the
older versions of Rubygems against 1.9.2, and we allow failures on 1.9.2
without marking the overall build as failed.

Summary:
This is using a list of paths as String objects and then converting them
to Path many (many) times. For normal Paths that's not great, but not
terrible since it's just an allocation, but for BuckUnixPath it requires
several allocations and interning of strings. This is a particularly hot
function (as it's used in depfile/manifest computation which doesn't do
quite the good caching that default/input-based keys do).

Let's get this right out of the way: this is awful and nasty, but it's somehow the least-awful-and-nasty. The crux of this issue is that it's possible for the LMS to return URLs that are neither relative, nor canonical, nor on the same origin that we're logged into. Fortunately, the so-far-always-correct case is that when this does happen, we are able to just convert the URL into a relative one, and that will always work.

This is fragile and finicky and not a great practise and _really_ shouldn't be necessary client-side, but it turns out the LMS is bad at knowing what it's own hostname is. So instead, every time we use window.d2lfetch, we can just run the URL through this helper and it'll change it if needed.

I really hope this only exists for a short while, until we can think of a better solution - preferably, the LMS should only be returning URLs that exist on the same origin as the page we're logged into!

These DMA drain buffer implementations in drivers are pretty horrible
to do in terms of manipulating the scatterlist.  Plus they're being
done at least in drivers/ide and drivers/ata, so we now have code
duplication.

The one use case for this, as I understand it is AHCI controllers doing
PIO mode to mmc devices but translating this to DMA at the controller
level.

So, what about adding a callback to the block layer that permits the
adding of the drain buffer for the problem devices.  The idea is that
you'd do this in slave_configure after you find one of these devices.

The beauty of doing it in the block layer is that it quietly adds the
drain buffer to the end of the sg list, so it automatically gets mapped
(and unmapped) without anything unusual having to be done to the
scatterlist in driver/scsi or drivers/ata and without any alteration to
the transfer length.

When you turn off ARP on a netdevice then the first packet always goes
out with a dstMAC of all zeroes. This is because the first packet is
used to resolve ARP entries. Even though the ARP entry may be resolved
(I tried by setting a static ARP entry for a host i was pinging from),
it gets overwritten by virtue of having the netdevice disabling ARP.

Subsequent packets go out fine with correct dstMAC address (which may
be why people have ignored reporting this issue).

To cut the story short: 

the culprit code is in net/ethernet/eth.c::eth_header()

----
        /*
         *      Anyway, the loopback-device should never use this
function...
         */

        if (dev->flags & (IFF_LOOPBACK|IFF_NOARP))
        {
                memset(eth->h_dest, 0, dev->addr_len);
                return ETH_HLEN;
        }

	if(daddr)
        {
                memcpy(eth->h_dest,daddr,dev->addr_len);
                return ETH_HLEN;
        }

----

Note how the h_dest is being reset when device has IFF_NOARP.

As a note:
All devices including loopback pass a daddr. loopback in fact passes
a 0 all the time ;-> 
This means i can delete the check totaly or i can remove the IFF_NOARP

Alexey says:
--------------------
I think, it was me who did this crap. It was so long ago I do not remember
why it was made.

I remember some troubles with dummy device. It tried to resolve
addresses, apparently, without success and generated errors instead of
blackholing. I think the problem was eventually solved at neighbour
level.

After some thinking I suspect the deletion of this chunk could change
behaviour of some parts which do not use neighbour cache f.e. packet
socket.

I think safer approach would be to move this chunk after if (daddr).
And the possibility to remove this completely could be analyzed later.
--------------------

Patch updated with Alexey's safer suggestions.

guess what else ...

""It has also replaced the previous version that was there (from bug 1480194)"" and oh, surprise surprise, 1480194 is ACCESS DENIED!

they're not just using private tickets to hide security critical information from potential hackers and blackhats, no they also use it to hide shady AF things. Things that they fully know are shady as fuck and that they absolutely know a lot of people would not like. There's simply no other reason why they'd do that

but wait, that's not all. If you think an opt-out pref that 99% of people wouldn't know about even if it showed up in about:config BUT ALSO HAPPENS TO BE HIDDEN is kind of questionable, well ... the system addon that they use for this shit apparently looked or still looks for `toolkit.telemetry.coverage.opt-out` [1] instead of `toolkit.coverage.opt-out` as their documentation [2] claims

This PR deprecates the index audit output.
In general, the problem with the index audit output is that event indexing
can be slower than the rate with which audit events are generated,
especially during the daily rollovers or the rolling cluster upgrades.
In this situation audit events will be lost which is a terrible failure situation
for an audit system.
Besides of the settings under the `xpack.security.audit.index` namespace, the `xpack.security.audit.outputs` setting has also been deprecated and will be
removed in 7. Although explicitly configuring the logfile output does not touch
any deprecation bits, this setting is made redundant in 7 so this PR deprecates
it as well.

Current behaviour is to specify a parameter (-i) which governs the maximum
input size which will be considered. Any input size above this will be output
as the maximum input size. This can lead to peaks in the tail of the IS
distribution appearing incorrectly, as well as potentially breaking the calculation
of average input size.

This commit changes the current behaviour in the following ways:

- Previously, setting ""-i 0"" would either result in a crash or non-useful behaviour.
Instead, setting ""-i 0"" now removes the maximum input size. Rather than using the existing
array-backed storage, we switch to a hashmap which only stores non-0 entries (e.g. sizes x
for which there is at least one insert of size x).
- Introduce a new option ""--sparse|-x"" which sets the IS output into 'sparse' mode - IS
lines in this mode are only output where the total number of inserts is greater than 0.

This has been tested (on a random humgen test file) to produce identical to samtools/develop
when run with default settings (replicating default behaviour) and to agree on a bunch of randomly
selected insert sizes when using the new behaviour.

Remove infinite loop.

Remove the cool closure stuff :-()

Fix error.

Change to use the internally stored max index rather than the bound.

Add sparse array format (untested).

Remove unused variable.

Refactor to remove duplication of code responsibility.

Also checks that malloc returns successfully.

Initialise stupid.

Bug fix.

Change the return thing to kh_put.

Add an error message.

Don't add a new record if the value is 0.

This is meant to be sparse, but I suspect that 0 records are being added.

Store total for dense array.

Quick bugfix.

Make the sparse array say it has MAX items rather than TOTAL.

Most of these items will be 0.

Add 'sparse' mode for insert-size.

Fix option placement.

Change from void * to untagged union.

Not quite so horrible!

Remove nested functions (alas).

This is considerably more nasty, but sadly nested-functions is a gcc
extension. Instead, we declare some stupidly-named static functions in
another file.

Modified makefile to build new stats_isize files.

Reference uint64_t

Add a few explanatory comments.

We want to remove the index thread pool as it is no longer needed since
single-document indexing requests are executed as bulk requests
now. Analyze requests are also executed on the index thread pool though
and they need a thread pool to execute on. The bulk thread does not seem
like the right thread pool, let us keep that thread pool conceptually
for bulk requests and free for bulk requests. None of the existing
thread pools make sense for analyze requests either. The generic thread
pool would be a terrible choice since it has an unbounded queue and that

I made a decorator that calls a function, and catches any errors that
might be localization issues. If one of these types of exceptions is
raised, it logs the request and sets the locale to English and tries
again. Then I found all the places where @willkg's `uselocale` context
manager was being used and converted it to a function that used this
decorator. In my testing this makes emails robust to localization
errors.

I tried to make this a modification to the context manager originally,
but to run the wrapped code again would require ugly bad horrible
bytecode hacks. So I decided better not do that. Luckily, this was is
generic enough that it might be reusable for web traffic too. I didn't
look into this very much.

I tried to log these errors in a way that will make them easy to work
on. I am assuming that we have Sentry/Raven configured to automatically
add stack traces. If this assumption is wrong, we can add the stack
trace into the error message later. There is a test that verifies that
logging does indeed happen.

Move things around, test logging.

* Move locale selection closer to where it gets used.

This is a horrible, horrible hack. The actual feature we still need to
implement (for C++98!) is covered by PR12292. However, we used to
silently accept this code, so when we recently started rejecting it we
caused some regressions (e.g., <rdar://problem/11147355>). This hack
brings us back to the passable-but-not-good state we had previously.

a flag for now.

First off, thanks to Daniel Jasper for really pointing out the issue
here. It's been here forever (at least, I think it was there when
I first wrote this code) without getting really noticed or fixed.

The key problem is what happens when two reasonably common patterns
happen at the same time: we outline multiple cold regions of code, and
those regions in turn have diamonds or other CFGs for which we can't
just topologically lay them out. Consider some C code that looks like:

  if (a1()) { if (b1()) c1(); else d1(); f1(); }
  if (a2()) { if (b2()) c2(); else d2(); f2(); }
  done();

Now consider the case where a1() and a2() are unlikely to be true. In
that case, we might lay out the first part of the function like:

  a1, a2, done;

And then we will be out of successors in which to build the chain. We go
to find the best block to continue the chain with, which is perfectly
reasonable here, and find ""b1"" let's say. Laying out successors gets us
to:

  a1, a2, done; b1, c1;

At this point, we will refuse to lay out the successor to c1 (f1)
because there are still un-placed predecessors of f1 and we want to try
to preserve the CFG structure. So we go get the next best block, d1.

... wait for it ...

Except that the next best block *isn't* d1. It is b2! d1 is waaay down
inside these conditionals. It is much less important than b2. Except
that this is exactly what we didn't want. If we keep going we get the
entire set of the rest of the CFG *interleaved*!!!

  a1, a2, done; b1, c1; b2, c2; d1, f1; d2, f2;

So we clearly need a better strategy here. =] My current favorite
strategy is to actually try to place the block whose predecessor is
closest. This very simply ensures that we unwind these kinds of CFGs the
way that is natural and fitting, and should minimize the number of cache
lines instructions are spread across.

It also happens to be *dead simple*. It's like the datastructure was
specifically set up for this use case or something. We only push blocks
onto the work list when the last predecessor for them is placed into the
chain. So the back of the worklist *is* the nearest next block.

Unfortunately, a change like this is going to cause *soooo* many
benchmarks to swing wildly. So for now I'm adding this under a flag so
that we and others can validate that this is fixing the problems
described, that it seems possible to enable, and hopefully that it fixes
more of our problems long term.

This way, something like:

  *:where(.foo, .bar)

Will end up twice on the selector map, just as if you would've written
.foo, .bar.

But we're a bit careful to not be wasteful, so:

  .foo:where(div, span)

Will still end up using the .foo bucket.

It needs a bit of borrow-checker gymnastics to avoid cloning the entry
in the common path. It's a bit gross but not too terrible I think.

Peter is concerned about the extra scan of CLOCK_REALTIME_COS in the
timer interrupt. Yes, I did not think about it, because the solution
was so elegant. I didn't like the extra list in timerfd when it was
proposed some time ago, but with a rcu based list the list walk it's
less horrible than the original global lock, which was held over the
list iteration.

This will currently fail on platforms without support for getTypeName.
While an assert failure seems too harsh, I'm hoping we're OK with the
regression test failure, and I'd like to find out about what platforms
actually exist in this state if there are any so we can get
implementations in place for them.

But if we just can't fix all the host compilers to have a reasonably
portable variant of getTypeName and are worried about xfailing this test
on those platforms, I can add the horrible regular expression magic to
make the tests support ""unknown"" here as well.

* Improve error message when model.from_bytes() dies

When Thinc's model.from_bytes() is called with a mismatched model, often
we get a particularly ungraceful error,

e.g. ""AttributeError: FunctionLayer has no attribute G""

This is because we're trying to load the parameters for something like
a LayerNorm layer, and the model architecture has some other layer there
instead. This is obviously terrible, especially since the error *type*
is wrong.

I've changed it to raise a ValueError. The error message is still
probably a bit terse, but it's hard to be sure exactly what's gone
wrong.

any sane filter function.

People keep asking LSan to be available on 32 bit targets (e.g. https://github.com/google/sanitizers/issues/403)
despite the fact that false negative ratio might be huge (up to 85%). This happens for big real world applications
that may contain random binary data (e.g. browser), but for smaller apps situation is not so terrible and LSan still might be useful.
This patch adds initial support for x86 Linux (disabled by default), ARM32 is in TODO list.
We used this patch (well, ported to GCC) on our 32 bit mobile emulators and it worked pretty fine
thus I'm posting it here to initiate further discussion.

Stickybans are stored in the database.

Because byond has to keep its own list, most of this is about ferrying info between the database and byond, and keeping them synced up. Because of this, this system will properly convert existing file stickybans to database stickybans during first init. This system also plays nicely with file stickybans existing on both servers (ish): seen key matches will be merged together in the database, but the reason, date, and admin, will be taken from the first server to introduce the stickyban to the database.

This has further protections from rogue bans, but byond fixed those. I'm keeping them in anyways because they will be helpful if this ever becomes an issue again. They are: Enforcement of matches on already connected users are delayed for 5 seconds to see if the match will turnout to be fucked. Confirmed fucked stickybans will be disabled for the round.

This fixes a bug that kept stickybans from properly doing hub backed matching on servers that were not currently on the hub.

This adds a button to whitelist a ckey from a given stickyban, this uses an internal and undocumented byond stickyban field.

When we've introduced xz compression for rpm and debs, level 1 was
picked as it took roughly as long as gz (which we had before), while
still giving us smaller artifacts.

However, if we do a release, it would make sense to use a higher level.
In general, the release build should come mostly from cache anyways, so
its build time should be smaller, so the inflation of that time would be
less terrible.

Level 6 is the default of the CLI tools for xz (xzcat etc).

This shows my one problem with not having unittests -- basic API
expectations aren't well exercised by the integration tests because they
*happen* to not come up, even though they might later. I'll probably add
a basic unittest to complement the integration testing later, but
I wanted to revive the bots.

Essentially, alloc_fd() in a files_struct we own a reference to.
Most of the time wanting to use it is a sign of lousy API
design (such as android/binder).  It's *not* a general-purpose
interface; better that than open-coding its guts, but again,
playing with other process' descriptor table is a sign of bad
design.

 ""This one covers stuff which Arnd is waiting for me to push, as this is

  Essentially, this contains:
   - AMBA primecell device initializer updates - mostly shrinking the

     reasonable.
   - Getting rid of the NO_IRQ crap from AMBA primecell stuff.
   - Nicolas' idle cleanups.  This in combination with the restart
     cleanups from the last merge window results in a great many

The +DumpCode attribute is a horrible hack in AMDGPU to embed the
disassembly of the generated code into the elf file. It is used by LLPC
to implement an extension that allows the application to read back the
disassembly of the code. Longer term, we should re-implement that by
using the LLVM disassembler from the Vulkan driver.

Recent LLVM changes broke +DumpCode. With -filetype=asm it crashed, and
with -filetype=obj I think it did not include any instructions, only the
labels. Fixed with this commit: now it has no effect with -filetype=asm,
and works as intended with -filetype=obj.

When using Docker and especially on Mac OS X, performances are terrible when using a ""mount"" on the host inside the container. (which happens by default)

To optimize the performances, one of the tricks is to change where the application is going to write the cache and the logs.

This PR provides a new env variables `APP_CACHE_DIR` and `APP_LOG_DIR` which can be set to change where will be saved the caches and the logs.

I know we can do it per project BUT:
- I think that is a good addition to Symfony
- it would allow project like eZ Platform and eZ Launchpad to automate that optimization

The mvneta driver sets the amount of Tx coalesce packets to 16 by
default. Normally that does not cause any trouble since the driver
uses a much larger Tx ring size (532 packets). But some sockets
might run with very small buffers, much smaller than the equivalent
of 16 packets. This is what ping is doing for example, by setting
SNDBUF to 324 bytes rounded up to 2kB by the kernel.

The problem is that there is no documented method to force a specific
packet to emit an interrupt (eg: the last of the ring) nor is it
possible to make the NIC emit an interrupt after a given delay.

In this case, it causes trouble, because when ping sends packets over
its raw socket, the few first packets leave the system, and the first
15 packets will be emitted without an IRQ being generated, so without
the skbs being freed. And since the socket's buffer is small, there's
no way to reach that amount of packets, and the ping ends up with
""send: no buffer available"" after sending 6 packets. Running with 3
instances of ping in parallel is enough to hide the problem, because
with 6 packets per instance, that's 18 packets total, which is enough
to grant a Tx interrupt before all are sent.

The original driver in the LSP kernel worked around this design flaw
by using a software timer to clean up the Tx descriptors. This timer
was slow and caused terrible network performance on some Tx-bound
workloads (such as routing) but was enough to make tools like ping
work correctly.

Instead here, we simply set the packet counts before interrupt to 1.
This ensures that each packet sent will produce an interrupt. NAPI
takes care of coalescing interrupts since the interrupt is disabled
once generated.

No measurable performance impact nor CPU usage were observed on small
nor large packets, including when saturating the link on Tx, and this
fixes tools like ping which rely on too small a send buffer. If one
wants to increase this value for certain workloads where it is safe
to do so, ""ethtool -C $dev tx-frames"" will override this default
setting.

This fix needs to be applied to stable kernels starting with 3.10.

This allows EditEngine, ModularTransactions, and CustomFields to coexist in an uneasy peace. The ""EditPro"" controller applies a //different edit// than the CustomFields do, but everything works out in the end. I think.

Hopefully the horrible mess I am creating here will be short-lived.

If we instantiate a typedef named std::common_type<...>::type, which is defined
in a system header as decltype(... ? ... : ...), and the decltype produces a
reference type, convert it to the non-reference type. (This doesn't affect any
LWG2141-conforming implementation of common_type, such as libc++'s, because the
default implementation of common_type<...>::type isn't supposed to produce a
reference type.)

Replace intel_dsi_device and intel_dsi_dev_ops with drm_panel and
drm_panel_funcs. They are adequate for what we have now, and if we end
up needing more than this we should improve drm_panel. This will keep us
better aligned with the drm core infrastructure.

The panel driver initialization changes a bit. It still remains hideous,
but fixing that is beyond the scope here.

This also allows for any speed, even when it doesn't round to world.tick_lag, causing it to just alternate rounding such that it avgs to the requested speed.

I've attached a patch file which improves on the recently added
tabulous lib a lot, using it will require a bit more config-end logic,
but it's much more powerful and allows for things such as tabbars and
autotabbing.

List of changes:
* [awful] Add awful.hooks.userhook_create and
awful.hooks.userhook_call so external libs can easily add their own
hooks (tabulous uses these)
* Tabulous now uses a tabindex system, instead of a messy circular
table, every set of tabs is now a tabbed view, this is more practical
and allows for the same order to be retained even if the focus shifts
(otherwise, the currently focussed tag would always be the first one
in the tabbar)
* Tabulous now exports a number of extra functions that will help you
in managing your tabs efficiently
* Tabulous now has an autotab_start() function you can call
(preferably right after the require so any other hooks you may have
set up won't interfere with it), when this is on, any newly created
windows will automatically be tabbed into the current tabbed view if
you have one selected (if the focussed window is not part of a tabbed
view, tabulous will do nothing)
* Tabulous bugfixes

a flag for now.

First off, thanks to Daniel Jasper for really pointing out the issue
here. It's been here forever (at least, I think it was there when
I first wrote this code) without getting really noticed or fixed.

The key problem is what happens when two reasonably common patterns
happen at the same time: we outline multiple cold regions of code, and
those regions in turn have diamonds or other CFGs for which we can't
just topologically lay them out. Consider some C code that looks like:

  if (a1()) { if (b1()) c1(); else d1(); f1(); }
  if (a2()) { if (b2()) c2(); else d2(); f2(); }
  done();

Now consider the case where a1() and a2() are unlikely to be true. In
that case, we might lay out the first part of the function like:

  a1, a2, done;

And then we will be out of successors in which to build the chain. We go
to find the best block to continue the chain with, which is perfectly
reasonable here, and find ""b1"" let's say. Laying out successors gets us
to:

  a1, a2, done; b1, c1;

At this point, we will refuse to lay out the successor to c1 (f1)
because there are still un-placed predecessors of f1 and we want to try
to preserve the CFG structure. So we go get the next best block, d1.

... wait for it ...

Except that the next best block *isn't* d1. It is b2! d1 is waaay down
inside these conditionals. It is much less important than b2. Except
that this is exactly what we didn't want. If we keep going we get the
entire set of the rest of the CFG *interleaved*!!!

  a1, a2, done; b1, c1; b2, c2; d1, f1; d2, f2;

So we clearly need a better strategy here. =] My current favorite
strategy is to actually try to place the block whose predecessor is
closest. This very simply ensures that we unwind these kinds of CFGs the
way that is natural and fitting, and should minimize the number of cache
lines instructions are spread across.

It also happens to be *dead simple*. It's like the datastructure was
specifically set up for this use case or something. We only push blocks
onto the work list when the last predecessor for them is placed into the
chain. So the back of the worklist *is* the nearest next block.

Unfortunately, a change like this is going to cause *soooo* many
benchmarks to swing wildly. So for now I'm adding this under a flag so
that we and others can validate that this is fixing the problems
described, that it seems possible to enable, and hopefully that it fixes
more of our problems long term.

To fix this problem, check ->mm instead of ->active_mm, and this
means:

And therefore we should be OK.

Summary:
The requirement to manually use Whitebox created some terrible stringly-types
dependencies that would easily break with refactors. Let's not do that. I'd like
to move us away from using Whitebox entirely, but for now let's a least
centralize this.

Codemod for other call sides coming.

Including the weird quirks.

Changes:
* Deposit caculated according to same rule as client. (detailed below). Should always match client deposit now
* Deposit for multiple auctions now only collected once. Deferred calculation of deposit until all auctions listed.

Deposit calculation is as follows:

Base deposit calculation = MSV x 15/75% (depending on AH). However this is not rounded. Case to int is used (so always round down)
The remainder is held in a float.
The base is then multiplied by number of items, and the time multiplier (x2 for 24 hour, x4 for 48 hour)
The nearest (no of items or lower) no of items when multiplied by the remainder that creates a whole number is then multiplied by the time multiplier (x1/x2/x4) and then added to deposit.

Example:

Item sell price 1s25. Deposit 18.75c (15% of 1s25). So base deposit = 18, remainder 0.75. Time 24h (x2) Item count 1 = 36c. Remainder = 0.75 (n) Min = 1s. Deposit 1s

This reverts commit aac2fea94f7a3df8ad1eeb477eb2643f81fd5393.

It turns out that that patch was complete and utter garbage, and broke
KVM, resulting in odd oopses.

Quoting Andrea Arcangeli:
 ""The aforementioned commit has 3 bugs.

  1) mmu_notifier_invalidate_range cannot be used in replacement of
     mmu_notifier_invalidate_range_start/end.

     For KVM mmu_notifier_invalidate_range is a noop and rightfully so.

     A MMU notifier implementation has to implement either
     ->invalidate_range method or the invalidate_range_start/end
     methods, not both. And if you implement invalidate_range_start/end
     like KVM is forced to do, calling mmu_notifier_invalidate_range in
     common code is a noop for KVM.

     For those MMU notifiers that can get away only implementing
     ->invalidate_range, the ->invalidate_range is implicitly called by
     mmu_notifier_invalidate_range_end(). And only those secondary MMUs
     that share the same pagetable with the primary MMU (like AMD
     iommuv2) can get away only implementing ->invalidate_range.

     So all cases (THP on/off) are broken right now.

     To fix this is enough to replace mmu_notifier_invalidate_range with
     mmu_notifier_invalidate_range_start;mmu_notifier_invalidate_range_end.
     Either that or call multiple mmu_notifier_invalidate_page like
     before.

  2) address + (1UL << compound_order(page) is buggy, it should be
     PAGE_SIZE << compound_order(page), it's bytes not pages, 2M not
     512.

  3) The whole invalidate_range thing was an attempt to call a single
     invalidate while walking multiple 4k ptes that maps the same THP
     (after a pmd virtual split without physical compound page THP
     split).

     It's unclear if the rmap_walk will always provide an address that
     is 2M aligned as parameter to try_to_unmap_one, in presence of THP.
     I think it needs also an address &= (PAGE_SIZE <<
     compound_order(page)) - 1 to be safe""

In general, we should stop making excuses for horrible MMU notifier
users.  It's much more important that the core VM is sane and safe, than
letting MMU notifiers sleep.

So if some MMU notifier is sleeping under a spinlock, we need to fix the
notifier, not try to make excuses for that garbage in the core VM.

Since commit b2aaefd095c964491f2c93a, we correctly handle window gravities when
the border width of a client changes. Since most windows out there have a
NorthWest gravity, this means that most windows do not have this problem.
However, e.g. mplayer uses gravity ""Static"" and this causes this issue (any
gravity other than NorthWest will do).

This affects the fullscreen handling in awful.ewmh. The code has to set the
border width before it changes a client's geometry so that the move when the
border width changes doesn't matter.

No new integration test for this since I didn't find anything usable with a
non-NorthWest gravity. A test would be easy to write, just test if `c.fullscreen
= true ; c.fullscreen = false` restores the previous window geometry.

Reasoning is as follows:

A) The engineers already have space suits to work on the airless tcomms equipment

B) Station system maintenance should be engineering's thing

C) The RD already has robotics, genetics, xenobio, RnD, and toxins. Engineers set up the engine in ten minutes and are left to fuck around until something is blown up, so they need extra stuff more than the RD does

D) People can use NTSL/telecomms without having to use up a head role to fuck off all round and do so. As I said,the RD already has plenty of work he should be overseeing.


Also, because there is no reliable way to get to the voidsuits other than praying to the RNG god while being lost in space, removed them from the possible list of objectives. It also made little sense to be stealing old NASA gear that didn't even belong to NT in the first place.

It's been 20 years since I became a kernel maintainer, so despite how
much I'm loving my new career, this patch elicits deep feelings[0].

I went to 1997 USENIX, my first conference.  I remember[1] standing
around with Alan Cox, Linus, Ted Ts'o and David Miller as they wrote
the code for the BKL on a napkin.  I listened in awe as this
homeless-looking guy described porting Linux to the Ultrasparc, and
then described how he then proceeded to beat Solaris on *every single*
lmbench microbenchmark.[2]

A lot of it I didn't understand, but I got home knowing that I had to
work with this random bunch of hackers.  I had some firewalling hacks
which I turned into ipchains, and sent it to DaveM with a config
option to switch between the old ipfwadm code and my new code.  He
liked it so much he replaced ipfwadm entirely, and I woke up one day
as kernel firewall maintainer[3].

I found someone to fund my work the next year, and suddenly I was
doing my dream job full time.  I flew myself around Australia visiting
every LUG to convince them to come to the first Australian Linux
conference.  And of course, DaveM was top of my list for speakers.

There was so much work to do on the kernel; everywhere you'd look
there was code which could be simplified, improved.  I read the module
code and was so horrified at its complexity that I rewrote it, not
realizing how epic that would be.  Of course I broke lots of things;
halfway through the patch series I broke SCSI, so Linus applied up to
that point and we had half a module subsystem for a while; I was
literally in the airport in Tokyo on my way to Spain when he applied
it, too.  Every arch maintainer woke up to find they had to implement
a whack of complex relocation code, and I got a lot of grumbling.[5]

But one person disagreed with my approach so much and so continuously
that I developed a dread of reading my mail every morning: eventually
I wrote a filter to send their mail to a separate mbox, which I've
still never read and don't intend to.

But mainly, it was a huge amount of fun.  I got to hack, and geek out
with hackers all around the world.  When I flew into San Jose for the
first time, DaveM offered to pick me up: turns out he had a two seater
so I rode squashed under the rear glass on the overside parcel shelf
to see the sights (Sun campus, Berkeley).  Back home, I moved to
Canberra to join the legendary group of hackers at OzLabs.

The mailing list changed: I gradually learned not to be an asshole
(unless, y'know, it was *really* funny, and eventually not even then).
Most of my peers trended the same way.  The kernel itself became more
formal, more complex, and giant overarching changes became far, far
fewer.  There are still horrible APIs (the return value of
copy_to/from_user, using the same type for list heads and elements, to
name two[7]), but the modern calculus of disruptive changes means
sometimes we simply step over the broken paving stones instead of
repairing them.

I built a team around netfilter, then handed maintenence off to Harald
Welte and ceased contributing: I wanted him to own it entirely.  I was
more nervous handing module maintenance over to someone I've never
even met or spoken to, but it's clear now that with Jessica Yu I have
scored 2 for 2.  I'm as proud of choosing them as of any individual
piece of kernel code[8].

To my fellow maintainers: stay harsh on code and don't be afraid to
say ""No"" or ""Why?""; there really are more bad ideas than good ones,
and complexity is such a bright candle for us hacker-moths.  But be
gentle, kind and forgiving of your peers: respect from people you
respect is really the only reward that sticks[9].

Farewell all, and I look forward to crossing your paths again!
Rusty.

[0] Which means I'm now going maudle for NINE paragraphs! And no TLDR, bwahaha!
[1] OK, I remember this.  Reality may differ.
[2] There's no recording of this talk, but it was the best technical
    talk anyone has ever given on anything[1].
[3] On the internet, nobody knows you barely passed Computer Networking![4]
[4] OTOH I topped COBOL/Database programming, so I have no idea what happened.
[5] Except DaveM.  I'd written test reloc code for sparc/spac64, but
    he didn't know that so he just cheerfully reimplemented it.[6]
[6] Those reading this post closely may suspect that I have a massive
    hackercrush on David S. Miller.  Those reading the code closely, of course,
    already feel that way themselves.
[7] But set_bit finally takes a long!  Seriously...
[8] Though the ARRAY_SIZE macro and the poetry in lguest are a close second.
[9] Actually, bitcoin is a nice reward too; it's like crystalized machine
    sweat!

As Al so eloquently points out, the patch is crap. The old code was fine,
the new code was bogus.

It never dereferenced a user pointer, the ""->"" operator was to an array
member, which gives the _address_ of the member (in user space), not an
actual dereference at all.

We still use XKeycodeToKeysym() in a fallback path in case we're not
running on a decent enough system; XKeycodeToKeysym() is deprecated as
of version 1.12 of the X server, but since I don't want to copy a bunch
of code from GDK or, god forbid, from Xlib, for a fallback path, it's
probably more reasonable to just silence the compiler warnings - at
least until we can drop all the X compatibility crap, and just use
modern, or semi-modern, API.

The irq_seqno_barrier is a tradeoff between doing work on every request
(on the GPU) and doing work after every interrupt (on the CPU). We
presume we have many more requests than interrupts! However, for
Ironlake, the workaround is a pretty hideous usleep() and so even though
it was found we need to repeat the MI_STORE_DWORD_IMM 8 times, or about
1us of GPU time, doing so is preferrable than requiring a sleep of
125-250us on the CPU where we desire to respond immediately (ideally from
within the interrupt handler)!

The additional MI_STORE_DWORD_IMM also have the side-effect of flushing
MI operations from userspace which are not caught by MI_FLUSH!

We thought that no userspace is using them, but oops libdrm is using
them to figure out whether a driver supports modesetting. Check out
drmCheckModesettingSupported but maybe don't because it's horrible and
totally runs counter to where we want to go with libdrm device
handling. The function looks in the device hierarchy for whether
controlD* exist using the following format string:

/sys/bus/pci/devices/%04x:%02x:%02x.%d/drm/controlD%d

The ""/drm"" subdirectory is the glue directory from the sysfs class
stuff, and the only way to get at it seems to through
kdev->kobj.parent (when kdev is represents e.g. the card0 chardev
instance in sysfs). Git grep says we're not the only ones touching
that, so I hope it's ok we dig into such internals - I couldn't find a
proper interface for getting at the glue directory.

Quick git grep shows that at least -amdgpu, -ati are using this.
-modesetting do not, and on -intel it's only about the 4th fallback
path for device lookup, which is why this didn't blow up earlier.

Oh well, we need to keep it working, and the simplest way is to add a
symlink at the right place in sysfs from controlD* to card*.

v2:
- Fix error path handling by adding if (!minor) return checks (David)
- Fix the controlD* numbers to match what's been there (David)
- Add a comment what exactly userspace minimally needs.
- Correct the analysis for -intel (Chris).

ocfs2 can store extended attribute values as large as a single file.  It
does this using a standard ocfs2 btree for the large value.  However,
the previous code did not handle all error cases cleanly.

There are multiple problems to have.

1) We have trouble allocating space for a new xattr.  This leaves us
   with an empty xattr.
2) We overwrote an existing local xattr with a value root, and now we
   have an error allocating the storage.  This leaves us an empty xattr.
   where there used to be a value.  The value is lost.
3) We have trouble truncating a reused value.  This leaves us with the
   original entry pointing to the truncated original value.  The value
   is lost.
4) We have trouble extending the storage on a reused value.  This leaves
   us with the original value safely in place, but with more storage
   allocated when needed.

This doesn't consider storing local xattrs (values that don't require a
btree).  Those only fail when the journal fails.

Case (1) is easy.  We just remove the xattr we added.  We leak the
storage because we can't safely remove it, but otherwise everything is
happy.  We'll print a warning about the leak.

Case (4) is easy.  We still have the original value in place.  We can
just leave the extra storage attached to this xattr.  We return the
error, but the old value is untouched.  We print a warning about the
storage.

Case (2) and (3) are hard because we've lost the original values.  In
the old code, we ended up with values that could be partially read.
That's not good.  Instead, we just wipe the xattr entry and leak the
storage.  It stinks that the original value is lost, but now there isn't
a partial value to be read.  We'll print a big fat warning.

ListenableKey object returned by goog.events.listen and friends
indefinitely (this is already a bug - but this fix will make
that case less likely to cause terrible memory issue).

The fix is to ensure that goog.events.Listener (the concrete
impl of ListenableKey) remove all references to other objects
when it is marked as removed. This also inlines Listener#handleEvent
method to make the implementation cleaner.

The i_fetch instruction fetches two operands and places them
in the tmp_arg1 and tmp_arg2 variables. The next instruction
(such as i_plus) does not have to handle different types of
operands, but can get get them simply from the tmp_arg*
variables. Thus, i_fetch was introduced as a way to temper
a potentail combinatorial explosion.

Unfortunately, clang will generate terrible code because of
the tmp_arg1 and tmp_arg2 variables being live across multiple
instructions. Note that Clang has no way to predict the control
flow from one instruction to another. Clang must assume that
any instruction can jump to any other instruction. Somehow GCC
manages to cope with this situation much better.

Therefore, to improve the quality of the code generated by clang, we
must eliminate all uses of the tmp_arg1 and tmp_arg2 variables. This
commit eliminates the use of i_fetch in combination with the
arithmetic and logical instructions.

While we are touching the code for the bsr and bsl instructions,
also move the tmp_big[] array from top scope of process main into
the block that encloses the bsr and bsl instructions.

By instrumenting a dev server, I found that loading the change screen
for a single change plus 2 related changes and 2 conflicting changes
results in a whopping 25 loads of a ChangeNotes. On a SQL database
that's not too terrible, but git storage is enough slower and more
memory-intensive than SQL that this is noticeable. Plus, the
ChangeNotes approach is to parse EVERYTHING, which is often more than
we need.

Solve this problem in the way we solve all problems: throw a cache in
front of it. This data has the nice property that the entities parsed
from a particular SHA-1 are immutable forever, so we don't need to
worry about invalidation like we would with a cache keyed by, say,
change number.

select Cond, C +/- 1, C --> add(ext Cond), C -- with a target hook.

This is part of the ongoing process to obsolete D24480.  The motivation is to 
canonicalize to select IR in InstCombine whenever possible, so we need to have a way to
undo that easily in codegen.
 
PowerPC is an obvious winner for this kind of transform because it has fast and complete 
bit-twiddling abilities but generally lousy conditional execution perf (although this might
have changed in recent implementations).

x86 also sees some wins, but the effect is limited because these transforms already mostly
exist in its target-specific combineSelectOfTwoConstants(). The fact that we see any x86 
changes just shows that that code is a mess of special-case holes. We may be able to remove 
some of that logic now.

My guess is that other targets will want to enable this hook for most cases. The likely 
follow-ups would be to add value type and/or the constants themselves as parameters for the
hook. As the tests in select_const.ll show, we can transform any select-of-constants to 
math/logic, but the general transform for any 2 constants needs one more instruction 
(multiply or 'and').

ARM is one target that I think may not want this for most cases. I see infinite loops there
because it wants to use selects to enable conditionally executed instructions.

Admin could reset zram during I/O operation going on so we have used
zram->init_lock as read-side lock in I/O path to prevent sudden zram
meta freeing.

However, the init_lock is really troublesome.  We can't do call
zram_meta_alloc under init_lock due to lockdep splat because
zram_rw_page is one of the function under reclaim path and hold it as
read_lock while other places in process context hold it as write_lock.
So, we have used allocation out of the lock to avoid lockdep warn but
it's not good for readability and fainally, I met another lockdep splat
between init_lock and cpu_hotplug from kmem_cache_destroy during working
zsmalloc compaction.  :(

Yes, the ideal is to remove horrible init_lock of zram in rw path.  This
patch removes it in rw path and instead, add atomic refcount for meta
lifetime management and completion to free meta in process context.
It's important to free meta in process context because some of resource
destruction needs mutex lock, which could be held if we releases the
resource in reclaim context so it's deadlock, again.

As a bonus, we could remove init_done check in rw path because
zram_meta_get will do a role for it, instead.

Summary:
The config flags around type tags have become a little hideous.
The meaning of each one of them is not super clear. Sometimes hard to read.
I'm converting them to an enum backed string config.

- Adding the TypeTagConfig enum
- Updating all use of the old type tag flags to the new enum type
- Adding a testing hierarchy in instr test
- Update all configs

This code was awful in every aspect:

- to check whether to paint the symbol, it only checked the very first
  character in the caption string

- it calculated the size of the caption text, but then discarded that
  information

- very special-purpose code in a generic button class; this should
  have been in a separate class, without an undocumented ""magic""
  character triggering the code

- there are unicode characters for triangles pointing left and right
  (e.g. 9664 and 9654), these should have been used in the caption
  text

- if the plus/minus characters in the selected font aren't beautiful
  enough, a different font should be chosen, but implementing custom
  symbol rendering code is duplicated effort, violating the DRY
  principle

- it uses Canvas::polygon() instead of Canvas::rectangle()

- it bloats the WndButton::on_paint() method to more than twice its
  previous size; but where will this end when more symbols are
  implemented? (violation of the KISS principle)

Our goal is to access no more than one cache line access per skb in
a write or receive queue when doing the various walks.

After recent TCP_SKB_CB() reorganizations, it is almost done.

Last part is tcp_skb_pcount() which currently uses
skb_shinfo(skb)->gso_segs, which is a terrible choice, because it needs
3 cache lines in current kernel (skb->head, skb->end, and
shinfo->gso_segs are all in 3 different cache lines, far from skb->cb)

This very simple patch reuses space currently taken by tcp_tw_isn
only in input path, as tcp_skb_pcount is only needed for skb stored in
write queue.

This considerably speeds up tcp_ack(), granted we avoid shinfo->tx_flags
to get SKBTX_ACK_TSTAMP, which seems possible.

This also speeds up all sack processing in general.

This speeds up tcp_sendmsg() because it no longer has to access/dirty
shinfo.

Summary:
We currently cycle CSRF tokens every hour and check for the last two valid ones.
This means that a form could go stale in as little as an hour, and is certainly
stale after two.

When a stale form is submitted, you basically get a terrible heisen-state where
some of your data might persist if you're lucky but more likely it all just
vanishes. The .js file below outlines some more details.

This is a pretty terrible UX and we don't need to be as conservative about CSRF
validation as we're being. Remedy this problem by:

  - Accepting the last 6 CSRF tokens instead of the last 1 (i.e., pages are
valid for at least 6 hours, and for as long as 7).
  - Using JS to refresh the CSRF token every 55 minutes (i.e., pages connected
to the internet are valid indefinitely).
  - Showing the user an explicit message about what went wrong when CSRF
validation fails so the experience is less bewildering.

They should now only be able to submit with a bad CSRF token if:

  - They load a page, disconnect from the internet for 7 hours, reconnect, and
submit the form within 55 minutes; or
  - They are actually the victim of a CSRF attack.

We could eventually fix the first one by tracking reconnects, which might be
""free"" once the notification server gets built. It will probably never be an
issue in practice.

Test Plan:
  - Reduced CSRF cycle frequency to 2 seconds, submitted a form after 15
seconds, got the CSRF exception.
  - Reduced csrf-refresh cycle frequency to 3 seconds, submitted a form after 15
seconds, got a clean form post.
  - Added debugging code the the csrf refresh to make sure it was doing sensible
things (pulling different tokens, finding all the inputs).

Moves update_robot_modules_display() to fix a UI glitch where using the home to unequip a module wasn't making the module appear in the storage list until it was otherwise updated.

Robots no longer take fire damage from fire stacks, since they're otherwise immune to heat... also, fire stacks will gradually burn off and the borg will stop being on fire.

Newest clang compilers warn about ""misleading indentation"", and because
warnings-are-errors in our builds, that breaks the build.

The lzma code base is vendored in, so we might just have to update it,
but that's a bigger effort than just removing a couple of spaces (the
coding style of the file is horrible, but I will only change it as much
as the compilers ask for).

Removes a version of atom/movable/Move() that was in mob_movement.dm.
New proc called newtonian_move() that's called as a result of things like shooting a gun or spraying a fire extinguisher and as part of atom/movable/Move().
It pushes src if it's not under gravity and gives the object a chance to stop itself.
As a result, inertial_drift() is kill.
Moved Process_Spacemove() out to atom/movable. It does the same thing, it's called whenever a drift is attempted and stops the drift if it returns 1. Default check is to look for nearby lattices to make dragging shit around the station less annoying. Mobs still call it in Client/Move()
The mob version of Process_Spacemove() will shove non-anchored nearby objects out of the way if you try to move like that. For example if you're free-floating in space next to a closet and try to move right, the closet will drift off to the left.
Mechs call their occupant's version of Process_Spacemove() so mining with a mech isn't retarded. The pussy wagon does the same thing and thus no longer works like a jetpack. Will it be making a comeback?!?! (no)
Any move will attempt to keep dragging your pulled object, not just ones initiated by the client. Should make space wind a little less annoying. Was needed to make drifting not break your drags.
Mechs drift correctly without any special snowflake crap.
Spaceslipping is gone because fuck that shit
Space movement is now slow instead of fast. Having a jetpack helps go faster but even that's slower than current. Hopefully means nuke ops can see each other as they move to the station instead of losing sight of each other instantly. Having your hands full makes spacemovement even slower.
You can drift in office chairs and drag mobs in beds or the bed itself. Currently drifting diagonally while in an office chair is bugged and I need help to solve it. It winds up in cardinal movement instead of a diagonal one.
Changes up the jetpacking effects system to cause fewer errant ion trails but it's still awful code. In hindsight I shouldn't have bothered but here we go.

In the dark theme it's still the same as header background color, but
with 50% transparency. To avoid unnecessary transparency and browser
perfomance issues coming out of that (yes I *do* care about that), a
pre-calculated value combining it with background color is used.

Also, until now, code inside colored notes was looking awful. Now it's
using the 50% transparency and looks good. In order to avoid combinatory
explosion of variables, the transparency *is* used in case of notes, but
since cases like that are much less common, I don't think this is a
problem.

The light theme is not changed at all, except for adding a matching
semi-transparent variable.

Huge thanks to @Squareys for this suggestion.

Some of the indentation made the code awful to read. Fix that. Also,
introduce defines instead of magic hex values. Note that this includes
one change: We mask out know 0xff instead of 0x1ff. But 0x100 has always
been the clock enable bit. It doesn't make any sense to set it depending
on the clock calculation. Update copyright notices, too. I'll be working
on those files some more in the future.

Reference objects, not their IDs - this way when object is modified, it
is visible everywhere where it is used. Main changes:
- volume.pool - Pool object
- volume.source - Volume object

Since volume have Pool object reference now, move volume related
functions into Volume class (from Pool class). This avoids horrible
`storage.get_pool(volume).something(volume)` construct.

One issue here is since volume.source reference a Volume object from a
different VM - VM's template, now VM load order is important. Since we
don't have control over it, initialize vm.storage when needed - possibly
while initializing storage of different VM. Since we don't have cycles
in AppVM-TemplateVM dependencies, it is safe.

Also, since this commit, volume.source (if defined) always points at
volume of the same name from VM's template. Using volumes with something
else as a source is no longer supported.

Uniter: extract operations

So, this is an appalling branch, but it's not *quite* as awful as it looks, because:

  * much more than half of the added lines of code are *just* new tests
  * more than half what remains is just moved code, although it may be tricky to directly compare them
  * it's otherwise all sufficiently related that the components are annoyingly hard to judge in isolation -- it took a depressingly long time to come up with separations of concerns that made things arguably better overall, rather than wallpaper-bubbling the mess back and forth
  * the pre-existing tests have changed in exactly 3 places; 2 of those are checking for better error messages, and one of them is handling a notification callback that should always have been triggering but wasn't
  * and it's got a bunch of trivial drivebys too, which bump up the line count without affecting complexity

The best thing is that lots of Uniter code was extracted into the operation package, and split up into reasonably independent types:

  * operation.Operation expresses the common execution paths of install/upgrade/run-hook/run-action/run-commands
  * operation.Factory creates those various operations
  * operation.Executor is responsible for recording state changes as the operations progress
  * operation.Callbacks is, uh, all the yucky bits that didn't quite fit

So, most of the code removed from uniter.go moved to either op_callbacks.go or the operation package. The changes to modes.go were comparatively trivial:

  * the beginning of ModeContinue is now covered by operation.NewExecutor, which loads initial local state
  * u.operationState is now accessed via u.operationState()
  * u.currentHookName was used only in ModeHookError, and was inlined there
  * a bunch of repeated error handling was pushed up to the main uniter loop

As for the rest:

  * the context package got some trivial interface changes to assist in testing operation
  * operation.StateFile has a cleaner interface
  * action executions are no longer recorded as hook executions -- they act really quite differently, and should be treated as such

...and there are many things I did *not* do in this branch, despite the temptation, including:

  * recovering properly from agent bounces mid-action
  * handling juju-reboot in actions
  * allowing actions during hook error states

...but I think I've laid the groundwork for fixing those, and more.

We store handle on header of each allocated object so it increases the
size of each object by sizeof(unsigned long).

If zram stores 4096 bytes to zsmalloc(ie, bad compression), zsmalloc needs
4104B-class to add handle.

However, 4104B-class has 1-pages_per_zspage so wasted size by internal
fragment is 8192 - 4104, which is terrible.

So this patch records the handle in page->private on such huge object(ie,
pages_per_zspage == 1 && maxobj_per_zspage == 1) instead of header of each
object so we could use 4096B-class, not 4104B-class.

The following series of refactoring patches aim to fix the horrible mess that MallocChecker.cpp is.

I genuinely hate this file. It goes completely against how most of the checkers
are implemented, its by far the biggest headache regarding checker dependencies,
checker options, or anything you can imagine. On top of all that, its just bad
code. Its seriously everything that you shouldn't do in C++, or any other
language really. Bad variable/class names, in/out parameters... Apologies, rant
over.

So: there are a variety of memory manipulating function this checker models. One
aspect of these functions is their AllocationFamily, which we use to distinguish
between allocation kinds, like using free() on an object allocated by operator
new. However, since we always know which function we're actually modeling, in
fact we know it compile time, there is no need to use tricks to retrieve this
information out of thin air n+1 function calls down the line. This patch changes
many methods of MallocChecker to take a non-optional AllocationFamily template
parameter (which also makes stack dumps a bit nicer!), and removes some no
longer needed auxiliary functions.

Basically, we get the size we want the systray to be drawn at upon drawing
the tray, thus removing the query to the xcb_get_geometry function. As all
windows embedded in the systray are squares, their size is equal to their
height, so we simply force the size to be wibox_height * n x wibox_height,
where n is the number of embedded windows, instead of deriving it from the
largest embedded window (which, for example in the case of wicd, would be
200x200, way too much for one window on a regular wibox).

So by chance I looked into x86 assembly in arch/x86/net/bpf_jit_comp.c and
noticed the weird and inconsistent comment style it mistakenly learned from
the networking code:

 /* Multi-line comment ...
  * ... looks like this.
  */

Fix this to use the standard comment style specified in Documentation/CodingStyle
and used in arch/x86/ as well:

 /*
  * Multi-line comment ...
  * ... looks like this.
  */

Also, to quote Linus's ... more explicit views about this:

  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.cryptoapi/21066

Also improve the comments and some other details while at it:

 - Don't mix same-line and previous-line comment style on otherwise
   identical code patterns within the same function,

 - capitalize 'BPF' and x86 register names consistently,

 - capitalize sentences consistently,

 - instead of 'x64' use 'x86-64': x64 is a Microsoft specific term,

 - use more consistent punctuation,

 - use standard coding style in macros as well,

 - fix typos and a few other minor details.

Consistent coding style is not optional, at least in arch/x86/.

No change in functionality.

( In case this commit causes conflicts with pending development code
  I'll be glad to help resolve any conflicts! )

Looks like I didn't test with CONFIG_NVM enabled, and neither did
the build bot.

Most of this is really weird crazy shit in the lighnvm support, though.

Struct nvme_ns is a structure for the NVM I/O command set, and it has
no business poking into it.  Second this commit:

Does even more crazy stuff.  If a function gets a request_queue parameter
passed it'd better use that and not look for another one.

Keyboard struct lifetime is easy, but the locking is not and is completely
ignored by the existing code. Tackle this one head on

- Make the kbd_table private so we can run down all direct users
- Hoick the relevant ioctl handlers into the keyboard layer
- Lock them with the keyboard lock so they don't change mid keypress
- Add helpers for things like console stop/start so we isolate the poking
  around properly
- Tweak the braille console so it still builds

There are a couple of FIXME locking cases left for ioctls that are so hideous
they should be addressed in a later patch. After this patch the kbd_table is
private and all the keyboard jiggery pokery is in one place.

This update fixes speakup and also a memory leak in the original.

Avoid flickering and some redraws by blanking tiles needing it just
before writing if they're also to be written, or in a big batch right at
the end of processing each position update if they're still pending.
Looks a bit crap and dropping-y for sparse layers, but it seems to work.

Refactor the interactive move by encapsulating its redraw progress state
in a helper object rather than passing lots of stuff around. Move
responsibility for tile-side bookkeeping back into the surface
implementation where it belongs.

another mechanical change accomplished though the power of terrible Perl
scripts.

I have manually switched some ""s to 's to make escaping simpler.

While I started this to fix tests that aren't run in all configurations,
the massive number of tests is due to a really frustrating fragility of
our testing infrastructure: things like 'grep -v', 'not grep', and
'expected failures' can mask broken tests all too easily.

Essentially, I'm deeply disturbed that I can change the testsuite so
radically without causing any change in results for most platforms. =/

the problem we have in the short term.

This also removes the terrible react-transitions build. This is better

FTP is a terrible protocol these days compared to HTTP. IPv6 support is
spotty at best, it is much slower for the connect/begin transfer cycle,
and overall just doesn't provide anything HTTP does better. Start
killing bits that we've added to treat FTP as a first-class protocol and
regulate it to the back seat.

The expectation here is once this commit goes live to the production
site, the FTP mirror URLs themselves will get removed completely from
the database, and the FTP protocol object itself will get deleted.

The VST2 and VST4 instructions take two or four vector registers as
input, and store part of each register to memory in an interleaved
pattern. They come in variants indicating which part of each register
they store (VST20 and VST21; VST40 to VST43 inclusive); the intention
is that issuing each of those variants in turn has the combined effect
of loading or storing the whole set of registers to a memory block of
equal size. The corresponding VLD2 and VLD4 instructions load from
memory in the same interleaved format: each one overwrites only part
of its output register set, and again, the idea is that if you use
VLD4{0,1,2,3} or VLD2{0,1} together, you end up having written to the
whole of each register.

I've implemented the stores and loads quite differently. The loads
were easiest to implement as a single intrinsic that expands to all
four VLD4x instructions or both VLD2x, delivering four complete output
registers. (Implementing each individual load as a separate
instruction taking four input registers to partially overwrite is
possible in theory, but pointless, and when I tried it, I found it
would need extra work to get the register allocation not to be
horrible.) Since that intrinsic delivers multiple outputs, it has to
be instruction-selected in custom C++.

But the store instructions are easier to model individually, because
they don't overwrite any register at all and you can write a DAG Isel
pattern in Tablegen for each one.

Hence, my new intrinsic `int_arm_mve_vld4q` expands to four load
instructions, delivers four full output vectors, and is handled by C++
code, whereas `int_arm_mve_vst4q` expands to just one store
instruction, takes four input vectors and a constant indicating which
lanes to store, and is handled entirely in Tablegen. (And similarly
for vld2q/vst2q.) This is asymmetric, but it was the easiest way to do
each one.

This reverts commit 94c6cee91 (Add check for IDMAC configuration).
Synopsys says that only if internal dmac is not present, optional
external dma interface is present. When internal dmac is present,
'0' value in DMA_INTERFACE of HCON is reasonable. DMA_INTERFACE
indicates external dma interface. And idmac initialization is
prohibited now.

The commit should be reverted since: the check for IDMAC is not
reliable; falling back to PIO would provide awful performance; we
wouldn't expect to see instances of this block without DMA support.

For UP it's stupid to request an initialized cpumask for the clock
event devices. Though we need the mask set even on UP to avoid a
horrible ifdeffery especially in the broadcast code.

For SMP we can at least try to survive with a warning and set the
cpumask of the cpu we're running on. That gives a decent chance to
bring the machine up and retrieve the debug info.

I also think the method of getting rid of pstring isn't the right
one. I certainly do want to get rid of pstring/fstring, but the reason
for removing them is the use of arbitrary sized fixed length strings
on the stack and in structures. Changing to another fixed length stack
string format isn't really a win, and moving to use strncpy() is
actually worse than pstrcpy() as strncpy() has the absolutely awful
semantics of always zeroing all remaining bytes, so it ends up taking
a lot of cpu doing pointless memory writes.

I'd rather move to more use of asprintf()/talloc_asprintf() and
similar functions for dynamic string allocation.

You also have to be very careful about some of these system defined
string limits. One some systems PATH_MAX could be 64k or even larger,
which can quickly blow the stack out when you allocate a few of them.

parsing (and latent bug in the instruction definitions).

This is effectively a revert of r136287 which tried to address
a specific and narrow case of immediate operands failing to be accepted
by x86 instructions with a pretty heavy hammer: it introduced a new kind
of operand that behaved differently. All of that is removed with this
commit, but the test cases are both preserved and enhanced.

The core problem that r136287 and this commit are trying to handle is
that gas accepts both of the following instructions:

  insertps $192, %xmm0, %xmm1
  insertps $-64, %xmm0, %xmm1

These will encode to the same byte sequence, with the immediate
occupying an 8-bit entry. The first form was fixed by r136287 but that
broke the prior handling of the second form! =[ Ironically, we would
still emit the second form in some cases and then be unable to
re-assemble the output.

The reason why the first instruction failed to be handled is because
prior to r136287 the operands ere marked 'i32i8imm' which forces them to
be sign-extenable. Clearly, that won't work for 192 in a single byte.
However, making thim zero-extended or ""unsigned"" doesn't really address
the core issue either because it breaks negative immediates. The correct
fix is to make these operands 'i8imm' reflecting that they can be either
signed or unsigned but must be 8-bit immediates. This patch backs out
r136287 and then changes those places as well as some others to use
'i8imm' rather than one of the extended variants.

Naturally, this broke something else. The custom DAG nodes had to be
updated to have a much more accurate type constraint of an i8 node, and
a bunch of Pat immediates needed to be specified as i8 values.

The fallout didn't end there though. We also then ceased to be able to
match the instruction-specific intrinsics to the instructions so
modified. Digging, this is because they too used i32 rather than i8 in
their signature. So I've also switched those intrinsics to i8 arguments
in line with the instructions.

In order to make the intrinsic adjustments of course, I also had to add
auto upgrading for the intrinsics.

I suspect that the intrinsic argument types may have led everything down
this rabbit hole. Pretty happy with the result.

This switches the CoreFoundation sub-build to use `add_subdirectory`.
This has a few **MAJOR** benefits:
- CoreFoundation changes get tracked and cause compile/link triggers
- CoreFoundation warnings are surfaced in the build
- CoreFoundation dependencies are reflected in the right location
- Foundation dependencies are reflected in the right location
- The overall build is simpler

Eventually, it should be possible to further simplify this.

Unfortunately, a couple of hacks are needed to make this work.  The
sub-projects properties must be cached, but they were just passthrough
previously, so this is not too terrible.  Additionally, the library
control know needs to be saved/restored around it.  The worst thing here
is the need to manually collect the dependency as we do not have a
proper library target for the Foundation (Swift) library.  When CMake
gains proper Swift support, it should be possible to use `add_library`
and get a property target that we can use `target_link_libraries` with
permitting the dependency tracking to allow us to get that without
manual intervention.

The current code assumes that the sstring will have the same char_type as the
output_stream.  That was working well, until I was forced to change the type of
my basic_sstring to another one that is backed by signed chars.

Of course, the best solution for this would be to change the output_stream (as
well as the input_stream), to take a signed char as well.

And oh boy, have I tried. The data_sink assumes a char type, and when it tries
to allocate a new buffer from it, the buffer will have no other choice than to
be of a char type. Fix that one, and another one appears.

I eventually gave up when the code wouldn't compile because struct fragment has
a char type - and both using a template for such a simple struct, as well as
sprinkling casts all over the place where it is used, sounded like horrible
ideas to me.

It's true that quitters never win, and winners never quit. But for now, my
proposal would be to generalize the write code to accept basic_sstrings of
general types. At least the cast lives in a single place.

One of the major issue for TCP is the SYNACK rtx handling,
done by inet_csk_reqsk_queue_prune(), fired by the keepalive
timer of a TCP_LISTEN socket.

This function runs for awful long times, with socket lock held,
meaning that other cpus needing this lock have to spin for hundred of ms.

SYNACK are sent in huge bursts, likely to cause severe drops anyway.

This model was OK 15 years ago when memory was very tight.

We now can afford to have a timer per request sock.

Timer invocations no longer need to lock the listener,
and can be run from all cpus in parallel.

With following patch increasing somaxconn width to 32 bits,
I tested a listener with more than 4 million active request sockets,
and a steady SYNFLOOD of ~200,000 SYN per second.
Host was sending ~830,000 SYNACK per second.

This is ~100 times more what we could achieve before this patch.

Later, we will get rid of the listener hash and use ehash instead.

audit rule additions containing ""-F auid!=4294967295"" were failing
with EINVAL because of a regression caused by e1760bd.

Apparently some userland audit rule sets want to know if loginuid uid
has been set and are using a test for auid != 4294967295 to determine
that.

In practice that is a horrible way to ask if a value has been set,
because it relies on subtle implementation details and will break
every time the uid implementation in the kernel changes.

So add a clean way to test if the audit loginuid has been set, and
silently convert the old idiom to the cleaner and more comprehensible
new idiom.

* Added unres overlays, fixes overlay/power actions

Small lights that shine out to indicate open directions. They're not super pretty, but they aren't *that* horrible I think.
Because it's a light, it acts as a weak light source.

Also, all door overlays respond to power changes now, including area power loss. There was code in the overlay section for checking power states, but nothing to actually trigger it outside players opening the panel or something. This was broken before I made any changes.

* Makes overlays respond to power outages

The airlock overlay (bolt lights, etc) would not respond to the area power going out or coming back, even though it had code for it. This was broken before I added my code.

* Makes the Airlock update overlays when built

Long story short, the unres_sides variable wasn't getting set before the airlock spawned and did its first overlay update, meaning the unres indicators would be invisible until the door's state changed the first time. This makes the airlock run the update again just before the construction airlock object is removed.

The code in C4::Matches::get_matches is terrible and a bug has been introduced
by bug 12478 because of its way to handle uniqueness.

If search engine is elastic, simple_search_compat returns array ref of MARC::Record,
used as a string for the key of the matches hashref we get things like
""MARC::Record=HASH(0x8f76ab0)"".
Yes, terrible...

The file is never staged and we get an internal server error:
    stage-marc-import.pl: Can't locate object method ""fields"" via package ""MARC::Record=HASH(0x8f76ab0)"" (perhaps you forgot to load ""MARC::Record=HASH(0x8f76ab0)""?) at /home/vagrant/kohaclone/C4/Biblio.pm line 2691

To recreate the issue:
- Set SearchEngine == Elastic
- Create a matching rule on 999$c (you need to edit the existing one and specify
'Local-number' as search index, not 'local-number')
- Import a file with bibliographic records and use the matching rule you defined.

Test plan:
Import authority and bibliographic records with Zebra and Elastic using a matching rule.
Everything should work correctly.

Note: I found a bug when importing authorities using Elastic, see bug 17255 comment 38.

Although we already block EBB events which request sampling using
sample_period, technically it's possible for an event to set sample_type
but not sample_period.

Nothing terrible will happen if an EBB event does specify sample_type,
but it signals a major confusion on the part of userspace, and so we do
them the favor of rejecting it.

This now passes (or skips) without fail for me:

pytest parsl --config parsl/tests/configs/local_threads.py --maxfail=1

However, despite using local_threads.py, a large number of IPP controllers
and engines are started up - this is probably some rogue config somewhere.

* remove test that was starting up ipp always, no matter what the config.

* Remove monitoring DFKs which were causing pytest to hang

* remove explicitly declared monitoring configs, as these cannot be declared unless monitoring deps are present -- probably they should be declared/imported in a -mode only fixure or something like that

* remove explicit integration test invocations now covered by broader pytest

* change manual test labels from skip to a pytest mark so they can be not-skipped if desired

* mark ec2 local test as unfit for running in automated tests: ec2 code can't install the right remove parsl version automatically at the moment

* some fixture playing

* fix typo

* some progress towards local tests running

* remove annoying __del__s on monitoring that generate spurious test output error text

* WIP fixing up local tests

* Add less-boilerplatey local_config to be used instead of local_setup and local_teardown in common case of wanting to load/unload a config file without doing anything else

* all of the local tests that are left in this branch now pass

* move most local_setup/_teardown boilerplate to local_config

* turns out this test doesn't need a DFK at all

* some flake8 driven changes

* Make whitespace fixes driven by flake8

* more flake8 driven tidyup

* more flake8 driven tidyup

* more flake8 driven tidyup

* Add whole-run DFK pytest fixture. Remove many-config capability.

This change will (in non-local mode) load a single DFK for a specified
config, which will be used for all tests in the run.

For local mode, new ways of initialising tests are added: local_config,
local_setup and local_teardown, that can be used to write 'local'-mode
tests which do not interfere with other tests - the parsl test suite
local mode tests, at present, do lots of global stuff, and these new
parameters and methods allow that globus stuff to be more constrained
to individual test runtime.

This conflicts with the implementation of multiple test configurations
in one run - that feature causes the DFK to be loaded/unloaded for each
test module as pytest sweeps over the list of configs, even if the list
only has one entry.

Multiple test configuration handling is removed, and --configs is renamed
to --config.

The behaviour can be demonstrated by running:

pytest parsl/tests/test_bash_apps/test_apptimeout.py \
  parsl/tests/test_bash_apps/test_basic.py \
  --config parsl/tests/configs/local_threads.py --setup-show

before and after, where --setup-show will show when each fixture is executed

* attempt to fix previous bad commit

* fix up arg handling

* remove this branches changes to conftest, in favour of pulling in other branch

* add noci description back

* Remove conftest imports that interfere with pytest fixtures

Importing conftest into a test causes pytest to see fixtures as
new fixtures. This means if trying to scope the load_dfk as
session, rather than module, it tries to start that fixture again,
rather than continuing to use the existing DFK.

This at least causes the test to fail, because the newly
imported fixture attempts to load a DFK when one is already loaded;
and secondly attempts to load a DFK which is potentially very
expensive in a cloud/HPC environment.

These tests were using load_dfk to do pytest-like config loading
without using pytest, in __main__. The correct way to do this
should be to use pytest, and this PR removes those non-pytest
__main__ sections.

* add a bunch of debugging logs to help look for htex vs pytest hang on my laptop

* use fresh_config() style rather than mutating global state

* Add random ordering, a traditional way to find accidental inter-test dependencies

* remove @forked decorator that was making htex vs this branch hang... I'm not sure what was going on but maybe several atexit/other finalisation stuff running in a sub-process and shutting down network connections which then appeared to be hung in the main process?

* remove vestigial forked stuff

* fix type error/typo in debug lines i added to htex executor

* Make module-dfk fixture be module scoped. I had mistakenly thought this was the default. Prior to this commit, multiple use of config in parsl/tests/sites/test_local_exex.py was causing a hang and high CPU usage.

* use fresh config for test_rand_fail so it can set retries like it does on master

* Put pytest specific naughty DFK load check back in because I am tracking stuff down

* audit and tidy up more rogue DFK initialisations, using pytest_secret_arg temporary hack

* Move extreme scale executor mpi4py import requirement into start

Prior to this commit, attempting to construct a Config involving
the extreme scale executor would fail if mpi4py was not installed
with an exception message informing the user about that requirement.

After this commit, that exception will be thrown later, at the point
that a user attempt to load a DFK with that config.

This allows unused extreme scale executor configs to be imported
safely - most immediately, for test rearrangements in PR #1210

* change local monitoring tests to not globally import monitoring config that cannot be imported without pre-reqs installed

* tidy fluff at end of travis yaml

* make cctools installer throw an error if required environment variable isn't set. make script executable. remove bash from travis invocation because script has a shebang

The handling of mount flags in set_mnt_shared() got a little tangled
up during previous cleanups, with the following problems:

* MNT_PNODE_MASK is defined as a literal constant when it should be a
bitwise xor of other MNT_* flags
* set_mnt_shared() clears and then sets MNT_SHARED (part of MNT_PNODE_MASK)
* MNT_PNODE_MASK could use a comment in mount.h
* MNT_PNODE_MASK is a terrible name, change to MNT_SHARED_MASK

This patch fixes these problems.

Especially with blends and large tree heights there was a problem with
the fuzzer where it would end up with enough undef shuffle elements in
enough parts of the tree that in a birthday-attack kind of way we ended
up regularly having large numbers of undef elements in the result. I was
seeing reasonably frequent cases of *all* results being undef which
prevents us from doing any correctness checking at all. While having
undef lanes is important, this was too much.

So I've tried to apply some math to the probabilities of having an undef
lane and balance them against the tree height. Please be gentle, I'm
really terrible at math. I probably made a bunch of amateur mistakes
here. Fixes, etc. are quite welcome. =D At least in running it some, it
seems to be producing more interesting (for correctness testing)
results.

Commit 1b0b3b9980e (""kref: fix CPU ordering with respect to krefs"")
wrongly adds memory barriers to kref.

It states:

  some atomic operations are only atomic, not ordered. Thus a CPU is allowed
  to reorder memory references to an object to before the reference is
  obtained. This fixes it.

While true, it fails to show why this is a problem. I say it is not a
problem because if there is a race with kref_put() such that we could
end up referencing a free'd object without this memory barrier, we
would still have that race with the memory barrier.

The kref_put() in question could complete (and free the object) before
the atomic_inc() and we'd still be up shit creek.

The kref_init() case is even worse, if your object is published at this
time you're so wrong the memory barrier won't make a difference what
so ever. If its not published, the act of publishing should include
the needed barriers/locks to make sure all writes prior to the act of
publishing are complete such that others will only observe a complete
object.

one horrible cut / paste job from smbd, plus a code split of shared
components between the two.

the job is not _yet_ complete, as i need to be able to do a become_user()
call for security reasons.  i picked lsarpcd first because you don't
_need_ security on it (microsoft botched so badly on this one, it's not
real.  at least they fixed this in nt5 with restrictanonymous=0x2).
fixing this involves sending the current smb and unix credentials down
the unix pipe so that the daemon it eventually goes to can pick them
up at the other end.

i can't believe this all worked!!!

The 3ware 9500S-8 SATA RAID controller exhibits terrible write
performance when PCI memory-write-and-invalidate is disabled.  This is
easy to demonstrate by replacing pci_try_set_mwi() in the patch below
with pci_clear_mwi().  My benchmarks show the following:

MWI disabled: 15 MB/s write, 330 MB/s read
MWI enabled:  240 MB/s write, 330 MB/s read

Most motherboards will enable MWI without the driver having to set it
explicitly, so most people probably wouldn't encounter this problem.
For the few motherboards that don't enable it, this patch could give a
16x performance improvement for writing.

This issue does not seem to affect the 9550SX controller, but the patch
doesn't hurt it either.  I haven't tested any of the other 3ware
controllers.

  load code has been tested on the CellSPU hardware; see the i32operations.c
  and i64operations.c in CodeGen/CellSPU/useful-harnesses.  (While they may be

  correctly.)

- Fix truncating stores in bug 3193 (note: unpack_df.ll will still make llc
  fault because i64 ult is not yet implemented.)

- Added i64 eq and neq for setcc and select/setcc; started new instruction

It may not be perfect yet but the SB1 code is badly borken and has
horrible performance issues.

Downside: This seriously breaks support for pass 1 parts of the BCM1250
where indexed cacheops don't work quite reliable but I seem to be the
last one on the planet with a pass 1 part anyway.

Summary:
Never converted this TODO over from XHP.

NOTE: This looks terrible since the CSS didn't make it over, can one of you grab
the rules for .differential-property-table and .property-table-header? If they
aren't still in trunk, try history for html/intern/css/tools/differential/

Test Plan:
Made a property change, looked at it in Differentila.

The feature is experimental so it's disabled by default and probably has lots
of bugs. To enable it right click on a file/folder in the Files tab of the
Management pane and Select Settings -> [VCS] Integration. Then for folders that
are under that VCS's management, you should see a VCS choice box. Note that
when you select a particular commit using the choice box you are NOT checking 
out that commit so the content of the folder won't be changed. You can 
easily flip back to viewing the folder content itself by selecting ""working copy"". 
While browsing a commit or the working copy in the file manager, you should 
be able to view files and see diffs using the right click menu. Also note that 
performance usually stinks for SVN because of network performance.

Patch from Lennert Buytenhek

On the IXDP2800, the bootloader does an awful job of configuring
the PCI bus, so we make linux reconfigure everything.  Having a 1:1
pci:phys address mapping generally simplifies everything, so try to
allocate PCI addresses from the [e0000000..ffffffff] range, which is
the physical address range of the outbound PCI window on the IXP2000.
This does not affect any of the other IXP2000 platforms since they
all use their bootloader's PCI resource assignment.

gds/deployment#107 created an app_domain entry in hiera. This migrates
us to use it.

In order to ensure the tests continued to pass, I've added
hiera-puppet-helper, which allows you to specify a `let(:hiera_data)`
block for a test to stub out hiera data. There's no place to put global
hiera data; IMHO, this is a Good Thing.

There's a bit of nasty behaviour where if you don't specify all of the
parameters for a parameterized class, puppet will try to autoinject
values from hiera and blow up because of the way hiera-puppet-helper has
monkey-patched things, so I've added a counter-monkey-patch to just
completely disable automatic injection. This is horrible, and hopefully
we can find a better solution some time.

Once this is in, we can more easily gradually migrate one value at a
time from extdata to hiera.

Summary:
This diff enables `unbundle` flow to start creating `push_redirector` structs from hot-reloaded `CommitSyncConfig` (by using the `LiveCommitSyncConfig` struct).

Using `LiveCommitSyncConfig` unfortunately means that we need to make sure those tests, which don't use standard fixtures, need to have both the `.toml` and the `.json` commit sync configs present, which is a little verbose. But it's not too horrible.

This converts adb.c to use the kthread API.

It also changes adb_request so that if the ADBREQ_SYNC flag is
specified, we now sleep waiting for the request to finish using an
on-stack completion rather than spinning.  To implement this, we now
require that if the ADBREQ_SYNC flag is set, the `done' parameter must
be NULL.  All of the existing callers of adb_request that pass
ADBREQ_SYNC appear to be in process context and have done == NULL.
Doing this allows us to get rid of an awful hack in adb_request()
where we used to test whether the request was coming from the adb
probe task and use a completion if it was, and otherwise spin.

This also gets rid of a static request block that was used if the req
parameter to adb_request was NULL.  None of the callers do that any
more, so the static request block is no longer necessary.

Writing this change has led me to believe that the
concurrency here is just plain awful, and I need to
find a better solution than what I have. In particular,
there are too many threads:
 - the internal reader thread
 - application reader threads
 - application writer threads
And too many locks:
 - the SpdyWriter I/O write lock
 - the SpdyConnection internal state lock
 - each SpdyStream's internal state lock

What's currently very wrong is the internal reader thread
is updating state in the SpdyStream, and reading bytes from
the network into a particular stream. It is an error to hold
the SpdyStream's lock while reading, but we're doing it because
we need to hold the state on the buffer, position and limit.
We need to rethink this!

Chrome doesn't run into this problem because it can 'fire and
forget' events. We can't do that because SPDY writes need to
throw IOExceptions if the writes fail.

Firefox has a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad bug whereby a text input
which is `disabled` cannot be selected. This is especially problematic for our
install key field, which is a 40-character long hash which we want people to be
able to copy and paste.

It turns out that the ""readonly"" property works equally well for disabling
changes, but Firefox allows selection on those. This property is technically
HTML5 but is well-supported across all browsers.

Testing done:
Verified that ""readonly"" did the right thing in both Firefox and Chrome.

This is one part of many of a locale refactor. See
http://reviews.llvm.org/D17146 for an idea of where this is going.

For the locale refactor, the locale management functions (newlocale,
freelocale, uselocale) are needed in a separate header from the various _l
functions. This is because some platforms implement the _l functions in terms
of a locale switcher RAII helper, and the locale switcher RAII helper needs
the locale management functions. This patch helps pave the way by getting all
the functions in the right files, so that later diffs aren't completely
horrible.

Unfortunately, I have no access to an AIX machine to build with, so this change
has been made blind. Also, the original author (Xing Xue) does not appear to
have a Phabricator account.

This method was intended to update a host NUMA topology object based on
the usage from one or more instances. It was horribly complex because we
store host and instance NUMA topologies in fields of many other objects,
some o.vo-based and others not, and some of those fields aren't using
the correct type. It would be much easier have a method that expected
only 'NUMATopology' (host) and 'InstanceNUMATopology' (instance) objects
and we did any conversion necessary to get these before the call. We
already have such a function, 'numa_usage_from_instances', which was
actually being called by 'get_host_numa_usage_from_instance' once it
finished fishing through object soup, and there are only to non-test
callers to 'get_host_numa_usage_from_instance' to be updated. This means
we can make the below changes and remove this awful function once and
for all.

nova/compute/resource_tracker.py

  This call to 'get_host_numa_usage_from_instance' was passing in a
  'ComputeNode' object, whose 'numa_topology' field is of type
  'StringField' meaning the value could be in string format, and a dict,
  'usage', which may have contained a 'numa_topology' key. Now we simply
  check if the usage dict's 'numa_topology' field is set and, if so,
  pass that and the ComputeNode's 'numa_topology' field into the
  'numa_usage_from_instances' function, stopping to covert the former to
  an object if necessary.

nova/scheduler/host_manager.py

  This call to 'get_host_numa_usage_from_instance' was passing in a
  'HostState' object, which is a plain old object with a 'numa_topology'
  field, and a mostly empty 'Instance' object with only the
  'numa_topology' field set. Now we just pass the 'numa_topology' fields
  from both objects to 'numa_usage_from_instances' function, once again
  adding an earlier check to ensure the former is converted from a
  string if so necessary.
