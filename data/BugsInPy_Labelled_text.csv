* Add a util test to check if requires has effect on MRO (#2054)

* Add same util tests from requires for inherits decorator

* Document luigi.util.inherits decorator

* For inherits and requires decorator do monkey patching (#2054)

Instead of subclassing the task monkey patch the methods clone_parent
and requires, to avoid a MRO with the task having itself as parent
class.

Fixes #2054

After a worker is marked disabled, it will call get_work or
count_pending one last time before stopping. This call can fail on
count_pending when it has a unique task, as that task will now have no
workers but we try to look up the workers from each task.

To guarantee a more consistent state, we now clear the task list from
each worker on disable.",1,,,

If too many different autoconfig clients are open at the same time, it can
create too many open files for the operating system to handle. To avoid
this issue, we can simply cache the autoconfig client to ensure that the
same one is being used every time. However, the autoconfig client is not
thread safe so we must have a different one for each thread.

This resolves #1740

I'll only motivate this lightly as I assume the previous mistake was a
(serious) oversight.  This bug is a bit hard to realize, because when
you visit the scheduler in the browser the UNKNOWN tasks are not shown
so you don't see them accumulating.  You only notice that the page loads
slower for each day.

In our scheduler instance, there are currently 90% UNKNOWN tasks, most
of which would be pruned after this patch is applied. 90% because its
current uptime is 10 days. The 9 previous days have almost exclusively
UNKNOWN tasks meanwhile today has almost exclusively known tasks.

When the scheduler disables a task, we then ignore most other status changes
requested by the worker until re-enable. This had a weird result for me recently
when a group of tasks were repeatedly failing and many of them were disabled.
In order to stop the repeated runs, I marked them all as disabled. A few hours
later when the disable period expired for the automatic scheduler disables,
many of the tasks became PENDING again and started running. It took a while
before enough of them were scheduled with the right timing to become permanently
disabled.

To fix this, we now allow the permanent disable requested by the worker to
override the temporary disable triggered within the scheduler. Note that this
was the original behavior but it wasn't enforced in unit tests and got lost in a
refactor.",1,,,

This fixes an implementation detail, so that luigi.task.externalize
actually does what it says it does in the documentation.  Hence I
hope pretty uncontroversial. This makes it so that calling externalize
don't register a new task. A pretty serious bug.

Now, there's still a caveat, as we're mostly hiding that we do side
affects, if anyone would actually inherit from what is returned by
externalize.  That subtask wouldn't be registered either.

This code is quite easy to get wrong somewhere. Luckily luigi is
decently tested. To make me even more confident I also added a couple of
tests:

 * Two tests in task_test.py that didn't pass before.
 * I created the task_register_test.py file.
 * I added some util tests too, because they are also all about
   Copying classes and namespace clashes. And I want to be on the safe
   side.",1,,,

When adding tasks to an existing batch in get_work, we neglected to check
whether the tasks were schedulable. This meant that in production I found
my pipelines running batches that included jobs with PENDING dependencies.
In order to fix this, we simply add a check that the task is schedulable.

Note that even though self._schedulable(task) gets called twice in the
get_work loop, they fall under different branches of whether best_task is
defined, so this shouldn't slow get_work down much.",1,,,

To fix this, we simply filter the results of state.get_pending_tasks to
remove any tasks that don't include this worker.",1,,,

The idea is to not guess the encoding of ""Location"" header value

which should then be re-interpreted correctly by the remote website
in whatever encoding was used originally.

At the moment, we think the behavioral change introduced in a78338c was
a mistake. There were no test cases that covered the behavior of passing
global parameters positionally, so this commits adds that.

The major issue was partially solved in f5c3316, but I think that was
kind of an arbitrary fix that still breaks backward compatibility.
Please see the discussion in spotify/luigi#738.  Hopefully, nobody
started to rely on this intermediete behavior that would have existed
for about 2 weeks.

Eventually, we'll have to change the condition

        positional_params = [(n, p) for n, p in params if not p.is_global]

to just

        positional_params = [(n, p) for n, p in params]

just like we did in a78338c. Though that should be done after global
parameters have been deprecated for half a year or something at least.
People need time to change their cron lines from `--pool development` to
`--BaseHadoopJobTask-pool development`.  Then we can change it to

        positional_params = [(n, p) for n, p in params]

AND remove is_global (you can't just do one of them like we did in
a78338c)

I was seeing a lot of errors from assistants trying to run external tasks and
being unable to even find and load the class. It turns out assistants were
being treated as potential workers even by tasks with no workers. As a partial
fix, assistants can now only work on tasks that some worker is capable of.

This fix is great for workflows where external tasks only exist to check that
non-luigi jobs are complete, but won't work for tasks that are external to the
assistant but not to all workers.

On POWER systems, /proc/cpuinfo provides a 'processor' entry as a
counter, and a 'cpu' entry with a description (similar to 'model name'
on x86). Support for POWER in get_cpu_facts was added via the 'cpu'
entry in commit 8746e692c121d7081e5c545de8e98908a95b510b.  Subsequent
support for ARM64 in commit ce4ada93f9daae4e1806c612b5c2f96727dc3de5
used the 'processor' entry, resulting in double-counting of cores on
POWER systems.

When unit tests were later written for this code in
commit 55306906cf7577cc5a666bf6f3d0486dcf937c03, the erroneous values
were just accepted in the test instead of being diagnosed.

* Handle galaxy v2/v3 API diffs for artifact publish response

For publishing a collection artifact
(POST /v3/collections/artifacts/), the response
format is different between v2 and v3.

For v2 galaxy, the 'task' url returned is
a full url with scheme:

        {""task"": ""https://galaxy-dev.ansible.com/api/v2/collection-imports/35573/""}

For v3 galaxy, the task url is relative:

        {""task"": ""/api/automation-hub/v3/imports/collections/838d1308-a8f4-402c-95cb-7823f3806cd8/""}

So check which API we are using and update the task url approriately.

* Use full url for all wait_for_import messages

Update unit tests to parameterize the expected
responses and urls.

* update explanatory comment

* Rename n_url to full_url.

* Fix issue with overwrite of the complete path

checked.

* Fix filedescriptor out of range in select() when running commands

* Simplify the run_command() code

Now that we're using selectors in run_command(), we can simplify some of
the code.

* Use fileobj.read() instead of os.read()
* No longer use get_buffer_size() as we can just slurp all of the data
  instead.

Also use a simpler conditional check of whether the selector map is
empty

--force flag can be very dangerous, because it unconditionally
overwrites remote branch - if someone pushed new commits to the remote
repo after you last fetched/pulled, and you do push --force, you will
overwrite his commits without even knowing that you did that.  Using
--force-with-lease is much safer because it only overwrites remote
branch when it points to the same commit that you think it points to.

Unfortunately, I didn't catch these issues while reviewing #702.

After looking more closely at `php` options, `-S` requires additional
arguments (<address>:<port>) and `-s` may produce output if used that
way. So, matching ` -s ` seems to be better.

Also, `@for_app('php')` already asserts the presence of `php ` in the
command script. Matching `php -s` prevents the rule from fixing commands
like `php -t public -s 0.0.0.0:8080`.

We avoid pruning PENDING and RUNNING tasks while an assistant is live, as the
assistant is considered a stakeholder for all runnable tasks. Unfortunately,
the prune function is where we fail RUNNING tasks for which the running worker
has died. So when an assistant is alive, it becomes impossible for a RUNNING
task whose worker has died to ever change status.

This fixes the issue by separating the function to mark RUNNING tasks as FAILED
from the pruning function and ensuring that it gets called regardless of the
presence of assistants.

Values in HTTPHeaders were typed inconsistently: the class itself
assumed that values were of type str, while many callers assumed they
were bytes. Since headers are practically restricted to ascii, this
would work on python 2 but fail when certain combinations were
encountered on python 3 (notably the combination of GzipContentEncoding
with multiple preexisting Vary headers).

We're storing exceptions captured by Twisted on the media pipeline
cache, but we're also using the defer.returnValue method with our
own methods decorated with @defer.inlineCallbacks.

The defer.returnValue method passes returned values forward by
throwing a defer._DefGen_Return exception, which in its turn
extends the BaseException class and is captured by Twisted.

This way, the latest exception stored in the Failure's object may
also have an HtmlResponse object in its __context__ attribute. As
the Response object also keeps track of the Request object that
has originated it, you could figure it out how many RAM we're
wasting here.

This could easily lead to a Memory Leak problem when running
spiders with Media Pipeline enabled and a particular Request set
that tends to raise a significant number of exceptions.

Example triggers:
- media requests with 404 status responses
- user land exceptins coming from custom middlewares
