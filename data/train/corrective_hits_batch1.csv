The Automated File Upload (AFU) Ogone API requires a transaction code to be set,
either:
 - ATR for automated transactions
 - MTR for maintenance operations

The default is ATR and is used for submitting transactions in batch.
However, the server-to-server mode of payment_ogone only uses the AFU
API to create new credit card aliases, and not to process transactions.

Using the ATR transaction code requires the ATR feature to be available
in the Ogone Merchant account - a paying option that is otherwise
unused. Using MTR as the transaction code is sufficient for adding
aliases, and the corresponding feature (MTR) is available at no cost
in most Ogone Merchant Accounts.

The LLDB project requires an LLVM project containing both clang and

Avoid array growth in FilteredList

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

The method (*schedulerCache).FilteredList builds an array of *v1.Pod
that contains every pod in the cluster except for those filtered out by
a predicate. Today, it starts with a nil slice and appends to it.

Based on current usage, FilteredList is expected to return every pod in
the cluster or omit some pods from a single node. This change reserves
array capacity equal to the total number of pods in the cluster.

This is a set of 3 PRs targeting affinity predicate performance. (#57476, #57477, #57478) The key takeaway is approximately 2x speedup in the large affinity benchmark.

The unexpected increase in BenchmarkScheduling/1000Nodes/1000Pods seems to be an outlier, and did not recur on subsequent runs. The benchmarks have a moderate amount of variance to them, and I did not run them enough times to measure mean and standard deviation.

1. FanLincs have two nodes: one light and one fan motor. In order for each node to get detected as different Hass entity types, I removed the device-type check for FanLinc. The logic will now fall back on the uom checks which should work just fine. (An alternative approach here would be to special case FanLincs and handle them directly - but seeing as the newer 5.x ISY firmware already handles this much better using NodeDefs, I think this quick and dirty approach is fine for the older firmware.) Fixes #12030
2. Some non-dimming switches were appearing as `light`s in Hass due to an duplicate NodeDef being in the light domain filter. Removed! Fixes #12340
3. The `unqiue_id` property was throwing an error for certain entity types that don't have an `_id` property from the ISY. This issue has always been present, but was exposed by the entity registry which seems to be the first thing to actually try reading the `unique_id` property from the isy994 component.",fixed,,,,,TRUE

It seems this is a performance-critical function for unification-heavy code.
In particular, tactics relying on meta unification suffered an important
penalty after this function was rewritten with the evar-insensitive API, as
witnessed e.g. by Ncring_polynom whose compilation time increased by ~30%.

I am not sure about the specification of this function, but it seems safer
to revert the changes and just do it the old way. It may even disappear if
we get rid of the old unification algorithm at some point.

The field derives from a file name only in very specific cases, for
many cases it's a fixed string (for example, all ""auto-"" items are like
this). Also, even when it derives from a file name, it is processed a
bit, as suffixes are removed and the string is converted to lower case.

hence, let's name this field ""id"" instead, because that's what it is

This patch sends all the requests to the quorum leader instead of the first TS

that is, it picks the first address and that's it.

   So wait until recovery is complete before checking reclock.

2. Use onnode -p when setting reclock on all nodes.  That will cause

   recovery master is the late in the list and resets the reclock on

Before this function was changed it was really supposed to just change a
gas that was passed in in case there was an event that changed the mix -
but with the new name the caller will assume that they get a valid gasmix.
And promptly we had one caller that didn't initialize gas to be based on
the first cylinder before calling get_gas_at_time().

Instead of adding yet one more spot that knows about the oddity of the old
API I simply changed get_gas_at_time() to do what it name appears to imply
and fixed the other callers not to bother to initialize the gasmix.

oVirt/vdsm,b0bc4c6ab4a90ab5acb5032bb13954fa686c5ab0,"rpc: Lower logging priority just for getAllVmStats

Currently, we effectively disable logging of calls for several methods.
But we should consider whether it causes more harm to log the
corresponding information or not to log it.

We should avoid logging excessively large messages.  This applies to
getAllVmStats that may report quite a lot of information for many VMs.
But there is probably no good reason not to log everything about the
other methods currently silenced.  So with this patch we suppress
logging just of getAllVmStats.

We should be informed about that method as well, we handle that in
followup patches.

Add HA feature gate and minVersion validation

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

As we add more feature gates, there might be occasions where a feature is only available on newer releases of K8s. If a user makes a mistake, we should notify them as soon as possible in the init procedure and not them go down the path of hard-to-debug component issues.

Specifically with HA, we ideally need the new `TaintNodesByCondition` (added in v1.8.0 but working in v1.9.0).

utilum/rails,158c7eb1d61a28452e0aafd1e05314352eea2749,"rm `Column#cast_type`

The type from the column is never used, except when being passed to the
attributes API. While leaving the type on the column wasn't necessarily
a bad thing, I worry that it's existence there implies that it is
something which should be used.

During the design and implementation process of the attributes API,
there have been plenty of cases where getting the ""right"" type object
was hard, but I had easy access to the column objects. For any
contributor who isn't intimately familiar with the intents behind the
type casting system, grabbing the type from the column might easily seem
like the ""correct"" thing to do.

As such, the goal of this change is to express that the column is not
something that should be used for type casting. The only places that are
""valid"" (at the time of this commit) uses of acquiring a type object
from the column are fixtures (as the YAML file is going to mirror the
database more closely than the AR object), and looking up the type
during schema detection to pass to the attributes API

Many of the failing tests were removed, as they've been made obsolete
over the last year. All of the PG column tests were testing nothing
beyond polymorphism. The Mysql2 tests were duplicating the mysql tests,
since they now share a column class.

The implementation is a little hairy, and slightly verbose, but it felt
preferable to going back to 20 constructor options for the columns. If
you are git blaming to figure out wtf I was thinking with them, and have
a better idea, go for it. Just don't use a type object for this.

The code used WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING to force an spect ratio. This didn't
behave well if the left/top window borders were used for resizing.
Resizing with these borders changed the screen position of the right/bottom
as well, which is unintuitive and annoying.

Use WM_SIZING instead. Unlike WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING, WM_SIZING knows about
which border is being used for resizing and can act accordingly.

Note that the calculated window size doesn't necessarily match with the
size mplayer calculates, but this problem exists on x11 as well.

Convert service account token controller to use a work queue

Converts the service account token controller to use a work queue. This allows parallelization of token generation (useful when there are several simultaneous namespaces or service accounts being created). It also lets us requeue failures to be retried sooned than the next sync period (which can be very long).

Fixes an issue seen when a namespace is created with secrets quotaed, and the token controller tries to create a token secret prior to the quota status having been initialized. In that case, the secret is rejected at admission, and the token controller wasn't retrying until the resync period.",,,,,,

a customer reported that when using ""timeout http-request"" for slowloris

sets ""timeout http-keep-alive"" to ""timeout http-request"" when the former

Make healthchecks skippable, and check masters only

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

Previously kubeadm would abort if _any_ node was not Ready.  This is obviously infeasible in a non-trivial (esp. baremetal) cluster.

This PR makes two changes:
- Allows kubeadm healthchecks to be selectively skipped (made non-fatal) with --ignore-checks-errors.
- Check only that the *master* nodes are Ready.

**Which issue(s) this PR fixes** *(optional, in `fixes #<issue number>(, fixes #<issue_number>, ...)` format, will close the issue(s) when PR gets merged)*:
Fixes kubernetes/kubeadm#539

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

This PR is to fix a regression introduced in: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21004/files#r236998030

If user specifies schema, Spark don't need to infer data type for of partition columns, otherwise the data type might not match with the one user provided.
E.g. for partition directory `p=4d`, after data type inference  the column value will be `4.0`.
See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26188 for more details.

Note that user specified schema **might not cover all the data columns**:
```
val schema = new StructType()
  .add(""id"", StringType)
  .add(""ex"", ArrayType(StringType))
val df = spark.read
  .schema(schema)
  .format(""parquet"")
  .load(src.toString)

assert(df.schema.toList === List(
  StructField(""ex"", ArrayType(StringType)),
  StructField(""part"", IntegerType), // inferred partitionColumn dataType
  StructField(""id"", StringType))) // used user provided partitionColumn dataType
```
For the missing columns in user specified schema, Spark still need to infer their data types if `partitionColumnTypeInferenceEnabled` is enabled.

To implement the partially inference, refactor `PartitioningUtils.parsePartitions`  and pass the user specified schema as parameter to cast partition values.

## How was this patch tested?

Add unit test.

Fast, memory-efficient hash set, hash table implementations optimized for primitive data types.

This pull request adds two hash table implementations optimized for primitive data types. For primitive types, the new hash tables are much faster than the current Spark AppendOnlyMap (3X faster - note that the current AppendOnlyMap is already much better than the Java map) while uses much less space (1/4 of the space).

Details:

This PR first adds a open hash set implementation (OpenHashSet) optimized for primitive types (using Scala's specialization feature). This OpenHashSet is designed to serve as building blocks for more advanced structures. It is currently used to build the following two hash tables, but can be used in the future to build multi-valued hash tables as well (GraphX has this use case). Note that there are some peculiarities in the code for working around some Scala compiler bugs.

Building on top of OpenHashSet, this PR adds two different hash tables implementations:
1. OpenHashSet: for nullable keys, optional specialization for primitive values
2. PrimitiveKeyOpenHashMap: for primitive keys that are not nullable, and optional specialization for primitive values

I tested the update speed of these two implementations using the changeValue function (which is what Aggregator and cogroup would use). Runtime relative to AppendOnlyMap for inserting 10 million items:

Int to Int: ~30%
java.lang.Integer to java.lang.Integer: ~100%
Int to java.lang.Integer: ~50%
java.lang.Integer to Int: ~85%

xhochy/arrow,053cd2354cfc6803d7961344672c13f78be8bd38,"ARROW-5512: [C++] Rough API skeleton for C++ Datasets API / framework

This is almost exclusively header files, so I caution all against debating small details like function signatures, names, or what kind of smart pointer to use (if any) in various places. Instead, does the high level structure seem reasonable (or at least, _not horrible_) as a starting point to do more work?

Some of the naming of things is inspired by related concepts in Apache Iceberg (incubating) (https://github.com/apache/incubator-iceberg), which is a vertically integrated dataset metastore and reading and writing system specialized for that metastore.

Here is the basic idea:

* A Dataset (for reading, aka ""scanning"") consists of a schema (what kind of data you expect to receive) and one or more data sources
* A DataSource abstractly yields an iterator of DataFragment
* A DataFragment represents a roughly individual storage unit, like a file

As many interfaces involving collections are based around Iterators so that we have the option of implementating ""lazy"" Datasets that continue to discover their structure after we are already scanning. It is a common problem in data warehousing that creating a detailed manifest of what needs to be scanned grows linearly in time with the complexity of the dataset (e.g. the number of fragments).

I abstracted away the file-related logic from the high level interface since I would like to support other kinds of data sources other than file-based ones:

* Flight streams: each endpoint from a DoGet operation in Flight corresponds to a DataFragment
* Database-like clients: e.g. the results of a SQL query form a Fragment

There's some object layering issues that aren't worked out yet, and I think the only way to work them out is to work on implementation and refactor until we get things feeling right:

* It is the job of a FileFormat implementation to translate between
* Filtering can occur both at the Partition/Fragment level (i.e. ""skip these files altogether"") as well as at the post-materialization stage. In Iceberg these ""post-materialization"" filters are called ""Residuals"". For example, if the user wants `filter1 & filter2` to be applied and only `filter1` can be handled by the low-level file deserialization, we will have to apply `filter2` against the unfiltered in-memory RecordBatch, returning the filtered RecordBatch to the user

As another matter, this objective of this framework is to draw a distinction between the Schema of a file and the Schema of the Dataset. This isn't reflected fully in the headers yet. To give an example, suppose that we wish to obtain a Dataset with schema

```
a: int64 nullable
b: double nullable
c: string nullable
```

When reading files in the Dataset, we might encounter fields are won't want, or fields that are missing. We must _conform_ the physical data to the Dataset's desired Schema. Much of the hard labor will be in the file format implementations, so match up what's in the file with what the Dataset wants. We also must deal with other kinds of schema normalization issues, like one Parquet file having a field as ""non-nullable"" when the desired schema is ""nullable"".

Inferring the Schema of a Dataset when you don't know it outright is a whole separate matter. If you go to Scan a dataset without knowing it, you must necessarily do some amount of inference up front or just prior to scanning. We will need to offer both ""low effort"" (look at some, but not files, and do not expend too much energy on it -- e.g. in the case of CSV files you may reach a conclusion without parsing an entire file) and ""high effort / exhaustive"" Schema inference.

As far as the actual Scan execution we are likely to immediately suffer some thread scheduling issues when trying to Scan files in parallel as internally IO and CPU work is coordinated. The file reader implementations have their own internal parallelism so that's something to contemplate as well.

In any case, I suggest we start small by creating minimalistic interfaces to CSV and Parquet files to start, implement simple dataset discovery as we have now in pyarrow/parquet.py, but a bit more general, and then we can investigate the various more advanced features as described in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bVhzifD38qDypnSjtf8exvpP3sSB5x_Kw9m-n66FB2c/edit piece by piece.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

CSVs with windows style crlf ('\r\n') don't work in multiline mode. They work fine in single line mode because the line separation is done by Hadoop, which can handle all the different types of line separators. This PR fixes it by enabling Univocity's line separator detection in multiline mode, which will detect '\r\n', '\r', or '\n' automatically as it is done by hadoop in single line mode.

## How was this patch tested?

Unit test with a file with crlf line endings.

Closes #22503 from justinuang/fix-clrf-multiline.

llvm-mirror/llvm,cb6c95b202481587d74986f328a53733f509c39e,"[TableGen][AsmMatcherEmitter] Fix tied-constraint checking for InstAliases

Summary:
This is a bit of a reimplementation the work done in
https://reviews.llvm.org/D41446, since that patch only really works for
tied operands of instructions, not aliases.

Instead of checking the constraints based on the matched instruction's opcode,
this patch uses the match-info's convert function to check the operand
constraints for that specific instruction/alias.
This is based on the matched operands for the instruction, not the
resulting opcode of the MCInst.

This patch adds the following enum/table to the *GenAsmMatcher.inc file:
  enum {
    Tie0_1_1,
    Tie0_1_2,
    Tie0_1_5,
    ...
  };

  const char TiedAsmOperandTable[][3] = {
    /* Tie0_1_1 */ { 0, 1, 1 },
    /* Tie0_1_2 */ { 0, 1, 2 },
    /* Tie0_1_5 */ { 0, 1, 5 },
    ...
  };

And it is referenced directly in the ConversionTable, like this:
static const uint8_t ConversionTable[CVT_NUM_SIGNATURES][13] = {
  ...
  { CVT_95_addRegOperands, 1,
    CVT_95_addRegOperands, 2,
    CVT_Tied, Tie0_1_5,
    CVT_95_addRegOperands, 6, CVT_Done },
  ...


The Tie0_1_5 (and corresponding table) encodes that:
* Result operand 0 is the operand to copy (which is e.g. done when
  building up the operands to the MCInst in convertToMCInst())
* Asm operands 1 and 5 should be the same operands (which is checked
  in checkAsmTiedOperandConstraints()).

kraj/systemd,950c07d421c04e5aae99973479f4f13131fb45e1,"journal: make skipping of exhausted journal files effective again

Commit 668c965af ""journal: skipping of exhausted journal files is bad if
direction changed"" fixed a correctness issue, but it also significantly
limited the cases where the optimization that skips exhausted journal
files could apply.
As a result, some journalctl queries are much slower in v219 than in v218.
(e.g. queries where a ""--since"" cutoff should have quickly eliminated
older journal files from consideration, but didn't.)

If already in the initial iteration find_location_with_matches() finds
no entry, the journal file's location is not updated. This is fine,
except that:
 - We must update at least f->last_direction. The optimization relies on
   it. Let's separate that from journal_file_save_location() and update
   it immediately after the direction checks.
 - The optimization was conditional on ""f->current_offset > 0"", but it
   would always be 0 in this scenario. This check is unnecessary for the
   optimization.

Adds a new option to not serialize `null` values:

```php
$dummy = new class {
    public $foo;
    public $bar = 'notNull';
};

$normalizer = new ObjectNormalizer();
$result = $normalizer->normalize($dummy, 'json', ['skip_null_values' => true]);
// ['bar' => 'notNull']
```

This feature is the only missing part to add [JSON Merge Patch](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) support in [API Platform](https://api-platform.com).
It will also help supporting this RFC in all other projects using the Symfony Serializer.

Make healthchecks skippable, and check masters only

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

Previously kubeadm would abort if _any_ node was not Ready.  This is obviously infeasible in a non-trivial (esp. baremetal) cluster.

This PR makes two changes:
- Allows kubeadm healthchecks to be selectively skipped (made non-fatal) with --ignore-checks-errors.
- Check only that the *master* nodes are Ready.

**Which issue(s) this PR fixes** *(optional, in `fixes #<issue number>(, fixes #<issue_number>, ...)` format, will close the issue(s) when PR gets merged)*:
Fixes kubernetes/kubeadm#539

**Special notes for your reviewer**:

Builds on #56072

**Release note**:

```release-note

[FrameworkBundle] [SecurityBundle] Rename internal WebTestCase to avoid confusion

FrameworkBundle & SecurityBundle each had 2 classes called WebTestCase,
one of which is only meant for internal tests. To avoid confusion the internal
class has been renamed to AbstractWebTestCase and made abstract.

fujicoin/fujicoin,171ca7745e77c9f78f26556457fe64e5b2004a75,"estimatefee / estimatepriority RPC methods

New RPC methods: return an estimate of the fee (or priority) a
transaction needs to be likely to confirm in a given number of
blocks.

Mike Hearn created the first version of this method for estimating fees.
It works as follows:

For transactions that took 1 to N (I picked N=25) blocks to confirm,
keep N buckets with at most 100 entries in each recording the
fees-per-kilobyte paid by those transactions.

(separate buckets are kept for transactions that confirmed because
they are high-priority)

The buckets are filled as blocks are found, and are saved/restored
in a new fee_estiamtes.dat file in the data directory.

A few variations on Mike's initial scheme:

To estimate the fee needed for a transaction to confirm in X buckets,
all of the samples in all of the buckets are used and a median of
all of the data is used to make the estimate. For example, imagine
25 buckets each containing the full 100 entries. Those 2,500 samples
are sorted, and the estimate of the fee needed to confirm in the very
next block is the 50'th-highest-fee-entry in that sorted list; the
estimate of the fee needed to confirm in the next two blocks is the
150'th-highest-fee-entry, etc.

That algorithm has the nice property that estimates of how much fee
you need to pay to get confirmed in block N will always be greater
than or equal to the estimate for block N+1. It would clearly be wrong
to say ""pay 11 uBTC and you'll get confirmed in 3 blocks, but pay
12 uBTC and it will take LONGER"".

A single block will not contribute more than 10 entries to any one
bucket, so a single miner and a large block cannot overwhelm
the estimates.

UpdatedTransaction was previously used by the GUI to display
coinbase transactions only after they have a block built on top of
them. This worked fine for in most cases, but only worked due to a
corner case if the user received a coinbase payout in a block
immediately prior to restart. In that case, the normal process of
caching the most recent coinbase transaction's hash would not work,
and instead it would only work because of the on-load -checkblocks
calling DisconnectBlock and ConnectBlock on the current tip.

In order to make this more robust, a full mapWallet loop after the
first block which is connected after restart was added.

Right now, client-go has copies of various generic client packages which produces golang type incompatibilities when you want to switch between different kinds of clients.  In many cases, there's no reason to have two sets of packages.  This pull eliminates the copy for `pkg/client/transport` and makes `client-go` the authoritative copy.

Includes deferred restoration (mostly useful for eager execution).

Slot variables are created with their checkpointed values as soon as the variable they're slotting for is restored, so there's no need to override slot creation (optimizers already check for existing slot variables before creating a new one).

Changes the behavior of unnamed Checkpointable dependencies so that only other unnamed dependencies can interfere (named dependencies do not get a number). This should be a bit more robust, and will support property assignment syntax sugar in a future CL. It does mean that removing a name from a dependency will break the checkpoint (just like changing its name would).

As we add more feature gates, there might be occasions where a feature is only available on newer releases of K8s. If a user makes a mistake, we should notify them as soon as possible in the init procedure and not them go down the path of hard-to-debug component issues.

Specifically with HA, we ideally need the new `TaintNodesByCondition` (added in v1.8.0 but working in v1.9.0).

Added the option to handle whether the user wants to iterate through the

fixed formatting issues and code style.

I excluded this option from the config file. This stopped the check box value and the boolean from becoming offset. Since the option should always start as false.

 This still causes an issue with the Wiimote input, since the class variable that keeps the state will be wiped, but the check box value will stay the same after closing/reopening without closing the entire Wiimote configuration. I am looking for a way to resolve this.

I also reduced wait time to 2.5 seconds vs. the 5  seconds previously. Seemed to be a little long.

These changes apparently did not go through.

We now properly draw collections nested inside one collection (i.e. 2 levels

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

This patch makes hardcoded configs in ""mesos"" module to use ConfigEntry, avoiding issues on mistake like SPARK-26082.

Please note that there're some changes on type while migrating to ConfigEntry: specifically ""comma-separated list on a string"" becomes ""sequence of strings"". While SparkConf smoothly handles on the change (comma-separated list on a string is still supported so backward compatible), there're some methods in utility class (`mesos` package private) to depend on the type change, so this patch also modifies the method signature for them a bit.

## How was this patch tested?

Existing tests.

Closes #23743 from HeartSaVioR/SPARK-26843.

kubectl binary plugins

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

Introduces the ability to extend `kubectl` by adding third-party plugins that will be exposed through `kubectl`.

Plugins are executable commands written in any language. To be included as a plugin, a binary or script file has to

1. be located under one of the supported plugin path locations:
1.1 `~/.kubectl/plugins` dir
1.2. one or more directory set in the `KUBECTL_PLUGINS_PATH` env var
1.3. the `kubectl/plugins` dir under one or more directory set in the `XDG_DATA_DIRS` env var, which defaults to `/usr/local/share:/usr/share`
2. in any of the plugin path above, have a subfolder with the plugin file(s)
3. in the subfolder, contain at least a `plugin.yaml` file that describes the plugin

Example:

```
$ cat ~/.kube/plugins/myplugin/plugin.yaml
name: ""myplugin""
shortDesc: ""My plugin's short description""
command: ""echo Hello plugins!""

$ kubectl myplugin
Hello plugins!
```

~~In case the plugin declares `tunnel: true`, the plugin engine will pass the `KUBECTL_PLUGIN_API_HOST` env var when calling the plugin binary. Plugins can then access the Kube REST API in ""http://$KUBECTL_PLUGIN_API_HOST/api"" using the same context currently in use by `kubectl`.~~

(2) When a Chunk object is no longer in use, we maintain a free list
of Chunk objects, whose head is designated by ChunkHandle
free_chunks_list_, and with the Chunk->next pointing to the next free
list entry.  Together with (1), this allows us to avoid heap
allocation/deallocation of Chunk objects in the allocator, except
(rarely) when the vector<Chunk> grows.  It also makes all the memory
for Chunk objects contiguous.

(3) Rather than having the bins_ data structure be a std::set and
using lower_bound to locate the appropriate bin given a byte_size, we
instead have an array of bins, indexed by a function that is
log_2(byte_size/256).  This allows the bin to be located with a few
bit operations, rather than a binary search tree lookup.  It also
allows us to allocate the storage for all the Bin data structures in a
contiguous array, rather than in many different cache lines.  This
reduces the number of cache lines that must be moved around between
cores when multiple threads are doing allocations.

(4) Added fast path to GPUBFCAllocator::AllocateRaw that first tries to
allocate memory without involving the retry_helper_.  If an initial
attempt fails (returns nullptr), then we go through the retry_helper_,
but normally we can avoid several levels of procedure calls as well
as the allocation/deallocation of a std::function with several arguments.

(5) Commented out most of the VLOG calls.  These can be reenabled
selectively when needed for debugging purposes by uncommenting and
recompiling.

Items (1) and (2) were suggested by Michael Isard.

Added multi-threaded benchmark to test allocation under contention.

If sync period <=0, it will cause kube-proxy panic, see: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/proxy/ipvs/proxier.go#L728

That is, the input parameter for `time.NewTicker()` must be >0.

BUGFIX: Remove role check when deleting workspaces for users

This was broken by 5279a7489efcd3c5f5e411b6b5bda11ad1b4ca75.
Before, checks were done for the role TYPO3.Neos:Editor. However,
checking for AbstractEditor is pointless; workspaces are
now never deleted when a user is deleted. Since the deletePersonalWorkspace
method checks for existence anyway, there's no reason to do
this role check at all. If a user is deleted, their workspaces should be
deleted as well.

Disable the termination grace period for the calico/node add-on DaemonSet.  The grace period is unnecessary for calico/node and it delays restart of a new calico/node pod to take over routing and policy updates.

Setting the grace period to 0 has the special meaning of doing a force deletion, which avoids a slow round-trip through the kubelet and API server.

**Which issue(s) this PR fixes** *(optional, in `fixes #<issue number>(, fixes #<issue_number>, ...)` format, will close the issue(s) when PR gets merged)*:

Fixes #55013

**Special notes for your reviewer**:

**Release note**:

```release-note
Disable the termination grace period for the calico/node add-on DaemonSet to reduce downtime during a rolling upgrade or deletion.

In `SparkSubmit`, call `loginUserFromKeytab` before attempting to make RPC calls to the NameNode.

I manually tested this patch by:

1. Confirming that my Spark application failed to launch with the error reported in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22319.
2. Applying this patch and confirming that the app no longer fails to launch, even when I have not manually run `kinit` on the host.

Presumably we also want integration tests for secure clusters so that we catch this sort of thing. I'm happy to take a shot at this if it's feasible and someone can point me in the right direction.

### What changes were proposed in this pull request?

Explicitly clear registered metrics when `MetricsSystem` shuts down.

### Why are the changes needed?

See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29795 for a complete explanation. The TL;DR is there is some evidence this could leak resources after Spark is shut down, and that may be a minor issue in Spark 3+ for apps or tests that re-start SparkContexts in the same JVM.

### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?

The possible difference here is that, after Spark is stopped, metrics are no longer available. It's unclear to me whether this is intended behavior anyway.

### How was this patch tested?

See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29795 for more context:
- Spark 3 already passes tests without this change
- Spark 2.4 does too, as exists in branch-2.4 now
- Spark 2.4 fails tests if metrics 4.x is used, without this change

The last point is not directly relevant, as Spark 2.4 will not use metrics 4.x. It's evidence that it addresses some potential issue, however.

Closes #26427 from srowen/SPARK-29795.

However, during this callback we were trying to load the satellite assembly without checking if the file exists on disk, causing an unhandled FileIOException.

Adding the NeutralResourcesLanguageAttribute in PR #831 caused the CLR to directly go to the Main assembly for resources, without making the satellite assembly callback.

This adds a test which creates a material using the maximum number of
layers. All of the layers are assigned a white texture except the last
which is set to red. The default combine mode is used for all of the
layers so the final fragment should end up red.

Currently Cogl doesn't provide a way to query the maximum number of
layers so it just uses glGetIntegerv instead. This might cause
problems on GLES 2 because that adds additional restrictions on the
number of layers.

vinoski/otp,693cda7f01137eda93362a74abd6028c41d2f5c6,"beam_ssa_type: Speed up type analysis for huge functions

The type analysis pass (`beam_ssa_type`) keeps the type information
for all variables that are in scope. For huge functions, the
`join_types/2` function could get really slow when joining two
maps with thousands of variables in each.

Use a conservative approach to discard type information for
variables only used once by a `br` or `switch` in the same
block as the variable is defined in.

This approach reduces the runtime for the `beam_ssa_type` pass
from a few minutes down to few seconds for this module:

https://github.com/aggelgian/cuter/blob/master/src/cuter_binlib.erl

Rejected approach: Calculate liveness information for all variables
and discard type information for any variable that would not be
used again. That turned out to not work because some optimizations
would invalidate the liveness (in particular, substitutions could
lengthen the lifetime for a variable). Trying to update the
liveness information when doing the optimizations would be tricky.

Automatic merge from submit-queue (batch tested with PRs 39115, 39111)

Node E2E: Do not use sudo when untar node e2e tar ball.

`sudo tar -x` will [extract files with original file ownership](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/264464/sudo-tar-changes-extracted-files-ownership-to-unknown-user), which is not what we want.
This also causes problem to https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/1348.

Because in https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/1348 we move node e2e runner into a docker container. Inside the container, the user is `root` by default, so the tar ball has `root` ownership.

If we untar the tar ball with `sudo`, it will recover the `root` ownership and the following operation may not have enough permission.

No matter what, we should not recover the file ownership inside the tar ball because:
* We don't care it.
* It may even not exist on the host.

If an AggregationOperator is used inside a TableWriterOperator
for stats collection the AggregationOperator will leak, as the driver
thread will only destroy the TableWriterOperator, and operators
rely on getting destroyed by the driver threads to free up their
allocations.

This change also closes the memory context of TableWriterOperator
in close(), however that's just for testing as the memory reserved

As requested in [SPARK-4923](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-4923), I've provided a rough DeveloperApi for the repl. I've only done this for Scala 2.10 because it does not appear that Scala 2.11 is implemented. The Scala 2.11 repl still has the old `scala.tools.nsc` package and the SparkIMain does not appear to have the class server needed for shipping code over (unless this functionality has been moved elsewhere?). I also left alone the `ExecutorClassLoader` and `ConstructorCleaner` as I have no experience working with those classes.

This marks the majority of methods in `SparkIMain` as _private_ with a few special cases being _private[repl]_ as other classes within the same package access them. Any public method has been marked with `DeveloperApi` as suggested by pwendell and I took the liberty of writing up a Scaladoc for each one to further elaborate their usage.

As the Scala 2.11 REPL [conforms]((https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2206)) to [JSR-223](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/scripting/), the [Spark Kernel](https://github.com/ibm-et/spark-kernel) uses the SparkIMain of Scala 2.10 in the same manner. So, I've taken care to expose methods predominately related to necessary functionality towards a JSR-223 scripting engine implementation.

1. The ability to _get_ variables from the interpreter (and other information like class/symbol/type)
2. The ability to _put_ variables into the interpreter
3. The ability to _compile_ code
4. The ability to _execute_ code
5. The ability to get contextual information regarding the scripting environment

Additional functionality that I marked as exposed included the following:

1. The blocking initialization method (needed to actually start SparkIMain instance)
2. The class server uri (needed to set the _spark.repl.class.uri_ property after initialization), reduced from the entire class server
3. The class output directory (beneficial for tools like ours that need to inspect and use the directory where class files are served)
4. Suppression (quiet/silence) mechanics for output
5. Ability to add a jar to the compile/runtime classpath
6. The reset/close functionality
7. Metric information (last variable assignment, ""needed"" for extracting results from last execution, real variable name for better debugging)
8. Execution wrapper (useful to have, but debatable)

Aside from `SparkIMain`, I updated other classes/traits and their methods in the _repl_ package to be private/package protected where possible. A few odd cases (like the SparkHelper being in the scala.tools.nsc package to expose a private variable) still exist, but I did my best at labelling them.

`SparkCommandLine` has proven useful to extract settings and `SparkJLineCompletion` has proven to be useful in implementing auto-completion in the [Spark Kernel](https://github.com/ibm-et/spark-kernel) project. Other than those - and `SparkIMain` - my experience has yielded that other classes/methods are not necessary for interactive applications taking advantage of the REPL API.

Tested via the following:

    $ export MAVEN_OPTS=""-Xmx2g -XX:MaxPermSize=512M -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=512m""
    $ mvn -Phadoop-2.3 -DskipTests clean package && mvn -Phadoop-2.3 test

Also did a quick verification that I could start the shell and execute some code:

    $ ./bin/spark-shell
    ...

    scala> val x = 3
    x: Int = 3

    scala> sc.parallelize(1 to 10).reduce(_+_)
    ...
    res1: Int = 55

Adds a new option to not serialize `null` values:

```php
$dummy = new class {
    public $foo;
    public $bar = 'notNull';
};

$normalizer = new ObjectNormalizer();
$result = $normalizer->normalize($dummy, 'json', ['skip_null_values' => true]);
// ['bar' => 'notNull']
```

This feature is the only missing part to add [JSON Merge Patch](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) support in [API Platform](https://api-platform.com).
It will also help supporting this RFC in all other projects using the Symfony Serializer.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

`OrcFilters.createBuilder` has exponential complexity in the height of the filter tree due to the way the check-and-build pattern is implemented. We've hit this in production by passing a `Column` filter to Spark directly, with a job taking multiple hours for a simple set of ~30 filters. This PR changes the checking logic so that the conversion has linear complexity in the size of the tree instead of exponential in its height.

Right now, due to the way ORC `SearchArgument` works, the code is forced to do two separate phases when converting a given Spark filter to an ORC filter:
1. Check if the filter is convertible.
2. Only if the check in 1. succeeds, perform the actual conversion into the resulting ORC filter.

However, there's one detail which is the culprit in the exponential complexity: phases 1. and 2. are both done using the exact same method. The resulting exponential complexity is easiest to see in the `NOT` case - consider the following code:

```
val f1 = col(""id"") === lit(5)
val f2 = !f1
val f3 = !f2
val f4 = !f3
val f5 = !f4
```

Now, when we run `createBuilder` on `f5`, we get the following behaviour:
1. call `createBuilder(f4)` to check if the child `f4` is convertible
2. call `createBuilder(f4)` to actually convert it

This seems fine when looking at a single level, but what actually ends up happening is:
- `createBuilder(f3)` will then recursively be called 4 times - 2 times in step 1., and two times in step 2.
- `createBuilder(f2)` will be called 8 times - 4 times in each top-level step, 2 times in each sub-step.
- `createBuilder(f1)` will be called 16 times.

As a result, having a tree of height > 30 leads to billions of calls to `createBuilder`, heap allocations, and so on and can take multiple hours.

The way this PR solves this problem is by separating the `check` and `convert` functionalities into separate functions. This way, the call to `createBuilder` on `f5` above would look like this:
1. call `isConvertible(f4)` to check if the child `f4` is convertible - amortized constant complexity
2. call `createBuilder(f4)` to actually convert it - linear complexity in the size of the subtree.

This way, we get an overall complexity that's linear in the size of the filter tree, allowing us to convert tree with 10s of thousands of nodes in milliseconds.

The reason this split (`check` and `build`) is possible is that the checking never actually depends on the actual building of the filter. The `check` part of `createBuilder` depends mainly on:
- `isSearchableType` for leaf nodes, and
- `check`-ing the child filters for composite nodes like NOT, AND and OR.
Situations like the `SearchArgumentBuilder` throwing an exception while building the resulting ORC filter are not handled right now - they just get thrown out of the class, and this change preserves this behaviour.

This PR extracts this part of the code to a separate class which allows the conversion to make very efficient checks to confirm that a given child is convertible before actually converting it.

Results:
Before:
- converting a skewed tree with a height of ~35 took about 6-7 hours.
- converting a skewed tree with hundreds or thousands of nodes would be completely impossible.

Now:
- filtering against a skewed tree with a height of 1500 in the benchmark suite finishes in less than 10 seconds.

## Steps to reproduce
```scala
val schema = StructType.fromDDL(""col INT"")
(20 to 30).foreach { width =>
  val whereFilter = (1 to width).map(i => EqualTo(""col"", i)).reduceLeft(Or)
  val start = System.currentTimeMillis()
  OrcFilters.createFilter(schema, Seq(whereFilter))
  println(s""With $width filters, conversion takes ${System.currentTimeMillis() - start} ms"")
}
```

### Before this PR
```
With 20 filters, conversion takes 363 ms
With 21 filters, conversion takes 496 ms
With 22 filters, conversion takes 939 ms
With 23 filters, conversion takes 1871 ms
With 24 filters, conversion takes 3756 ms
With 25 filters, conversion takes 7452 ms
With 26 filters, conversion takes 14978 ms
With 27 filters, conversion takes 30519 ms
With 28 filters, conversion takes 60361 ms // 1 minute
With 29 filters, conversion takes 126575 ms // 2 minutes 6 seconds
With 30 filters, conversion takes 257369 ms // 4 minutes 17 seconds
```

### After this PR
```

With 21 filters, conversion takes 0 ms
With 22 filters, conversion takes 1 ms
With 23 filters, conversion takes 0 ms
With 24 filters, conversion takes 1 ms
With 25 filters, conversion takes 1 ms

With 27 filters, conversion takes 1 ms
With 28 filters, conversion takes 0 ms
With 29 filters, conversion takes 1 ms
With 30 filters, conversion takes 0 ms
```

## How was this patch tested?

There are no changes in behaviour, and the existing tests pass. Added new benchmarks that expose the problematic behaviour and they finish quickly with the changes applied.

Automatic merge from submit-queue (batch tested with PRs 39115, 39111)

Node E2E: Do not use sudo when untar node e2e tar ball.

`sudo tar -x` will [extract files with original file ownership](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/264464/sudo-tar-changes-extracted-files-ownership-to-unknown-user), which is not what we want.
This also causes problem to https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/1348.

Because in https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/1348 we move node e2e runner into a docker container. Inside the container, the user is `root` by default, so the tar ball has `root` ownership.

If we untar the tar ball with `sudo`, it will recover the `root` ownership and the following operation may not have enough permission.

No matter what, we should not recover the file ownership inside the tar ball because:
* We don't care it.
* It may even not exist on the host.

This introduces undesirable `Rails.logger` formatters (such as the syslog
formatter) onto a `Logger.new(STDERR)` for the console. The production
logger may be going elsewhere than standard io, so we can't presume to
reuse its formatter.

With syslog, this causes missing newlines in the console, so irb prompts
start at the end of the last log message.

We can work to expose the console formatter in another way to address
the original issue.

**Which issue this PR fixes**: fixes #49535 

**Special notes for your reviewer**:
The actual type of clientSet.Core() is already the same with clientSet.CoreV1(), so it should be safe replacement.
The places that clientSet.Core() are still in use are identified by IDE ""find usages"", and changes are made with one time global replace. Hopefully there will be none left after this PR merged.
Let me know if this PR is too big to review, I can split it into some smaller ones.

This is an attempt to use the random_bytes function when generating secure random numbers. This function is included in PHP 7 or through the ""paragonie/random_compat"" library.

This PR only adds support to use the function if it is available. Changes that can be added is to add a hard dependency on the paragonie/random_compat library, so all current functionality can be deprecated.

Automatic merge from submit-queue (batch tested with PRs 50531, 50853, 49976, 50939, 50607)

Updated gRPC vendoring to support Keep Alive

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

This PR bumps the version of the vendored version of gRPC from v1.0.4 to v1.5.1
This is needed as part of the Device Plugin API where we expect client and server to use the Keep alive feature in order to detect an error.

Unfortunately I had to also bump the version of `golang.org/x/text` and `golang.org/x/net`.

shahmishal/swift,8acc11f80c5421540f16ecf8ae0575c429877306,"Sema: Fix ambiguity resolution when doing unqualified lookup of associated types and type aliases

In structural lookup mode, let's resolve protocol typealiases to
dependent member types also. This is because areSameType() has
no way to see if a type alias is going to be equal to another
associated type with the same name, and so it would return false,
which produced ambiguity errors when there should not be any.

This exposes a deficiency in how we diagnose same-type constraints
where both sides are concrete. Instead of performing the check on
the requirement types, which might be dependent member types that
later on resolve to concrete types, do the check on the actual
equivalence classes further down in the GSB instead.

However, this in turn produces bogus diagnostics in some recursive
cases where we add same-type constraints twice for some reason,
resulting in a warning the second time around. Refine the check by
adding a new predicate to FloatingRequirementSource for requirements
that are explicitly written in source... which is not what
isExplicit() currently means.

facebook/flow,b33ce6ea80a426e8e971ab08a5bc3a107fd9ab33,"Fix spread argument nontermination

Summary:
There were reports of nontermination on GitHub. I looked at one of the
repros, which I could distill to the smaller repro:

  function foo(...args) { foo(...args); }
  foo();

Without the `foo()` call, it was fine. However, the `foo()` call could send it
into infinite recursion. Not sure why the caching doesn't catch this case.
Anyway, there's a better malicious case of

  function foo(...args) { foo(1, ...args); }
  foo();

Where we infer `args` to be `[]`, then `[] | [1]`, then `[] | [1] | [1, 1]`,
and so on. We definitely need to bust the constant folding.

The cleanest way is to turn tuples and array literals into non-literal arrays,
which defeats the constant folding. So in the above case, `args` will
eventually be inferred to be `[] | [1] | Array<1>`

Fixes #3443

There are many operations that are currently not supported in the streaming execution. For example:
 - joining two streams

 - sorting
 - window functions (not time windows)
 - distinct aggregates

Furthermore, executing a query with a stream source as a batch query should also fail.

This patch add an additional step after analysis in the QueryExecution which will check that all the operations in the analyzed logical plan is supported or not.

When checking in an on-hold item which is waiting, the ""Cancel"" button
cancels the hold, so it should say so. This patch changes the text.

This patch also moves the 'cancel hold' button to the middle, on the
theory that buttons on the left should default to 'confirm' and buttons
on the right should generally imply 'cancel'--as in 'do nothing.' Moving
it to the middle seems like a good place to put it where users will have
to think about clicking it.

To test:

1. Find an hold which has been made 'waiting,' or check in an confirm a
   pending hold at your library.
2. Check in that item again and verify that the 'Hold found' dialog
   contains a 'Cancel hold' button which works to cancel the waiting
   hold.
3. Repeat the process and confirm that the functionality of the other
   buttons is unchanged.

Followed test plan, works as expected.

This commit also fixes two nasty issues in table layout:

stevesloka/kubernetes,d68cd8a0c7e6137ca4219078a3d651ecff03c21f,"Expose object tracker for fake clientsets

Not every object kind can be registered via tracker .Add() called as
part of SimpleClientset initialization. This is because .Add() relies
on UnsafeGuessKindToResource to convert object kinds into resource
type names, which is broken for some resources. An example of an
affected kind is NetworkAttachmentDefinitions CRD that uses
network-attachment-definitions as its resource type name. When
UnsafeGuessKindToResource is called for this kind, it returns
networkattachmentdefinitions (without dashes).

As per the comment inside .Add, kinds affected by
UnsafeGuessKindToResource deficiencies should instead register objects
using tracker .Create() method.  Problem is, current SimpleClientset
struct definition doesn't expose the object tracker in any way, which
makes it impossible to properly register these kinds at all.

To address the issue, this change modifies the definition of
SimpleClientset struct to expose the object tracker used via Tracker()
method.

Support containerized kubelet in CI

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

  * Adjust hyperkube Makefile to allow HYPERKUBE_BIN to be
    specified from outside

  * new DOCKER_ROOT variable to specify --root-dir and associated
    volume for kubelet to know where docker directory lives

  * Save the docker logs when we kill the kubelet container

  * Allow customized image for dockerized kubelet and build a Default
    image if one is not specified

  We should allow a custom build using script we have:
  `VERSION=""latest"" REGISTRY=""k8s.gcr.io"" hack/dev-push-hyperkube.sh`

  to be used quickly using DOCKERIZE_KUBELET. To do this we remove the
  hard coded `k8s.gcr.io/kubelet` image and introduce a new environment
  variable `KUBELET_IMAGE`.

  Note that we are switching to hyperkube from kubelet as we have a quick
  and easy script to build hyperkube image and load it into local docker
  daemon. This reduces bad hacks like `docker tag
  k8s.gcr.io/hyperkube-amd64:<tag> k8s.gcr.io/kubelet:latest` being used
  by folks today (see 62057)

  * Better cope with PID 0 when running ""docker inspect"" to look for
    the process id for kubelet container

When you copy a reference to a class from PHPStorm it always start the FQCN with a backslash.

When you now try to search the container for this class using `bin/console debug:container ""\My\Class""` it cannot find it.

This PR always removes the starting backslash before searching the container to avoid this issue.

This PR integrates the new Twig 1.18 Profiler (see twigphp/Twig#1597) into Symfony (replace the current TimedTwigEngine) and adds  a new Twig panel.

The timers are now available for all rendered templates (TimedTwigEngine was only able to get information from a few of them -- mainly the first template only).

The Twig panel gives you a lot of information about the execution of the templates, including a call graph.

i noticed when writing commands i always keep doing

```php
$io = new SymfonyStyle($input, $output);
$answer = $io->ask('...', null, function ($value) { return $value; });

// instead of just
$answer = $io->ask('...');
```

only to bypass a built-in validation, of which im not sure why it's there. Note the base question helper doesnt make this assumption...

Example of new rewrites enabled by this change:

This change also cleans up the code in SimplifyNode to consistently rely on only graph_modified_ (and possibly an error status) to signal if the graph was updated.

Conversely, we would skip the field type if it contained an

to force to emit, for instance something like (T, X) where T is
a generic parameter and X is a nominal type.

A final side effect is we no longer try to emit type metadata for

There is a bug when we try to grow the buffer, OOM is ignore wrongly (the assert also skipped by JVM), then we try grow the array again, this one will trigger spilling free the current page, the current record we inserted will be invalid.

The root cause is that JVM has less free memory than MemoryManager thought, it will OOM when allocate a page without trigger spilling. We should catch the OOM, and acquire memory again to trigger spilling.

And also, we could not grow the array in `insertRecord` of `InMemorySorter` (it was there just for easy testing).

delete_port() calls to disassociate_floatingips() while in transaction.
The latter method sends RPC notification which may result in eventlet
yield. If yield switches a thread to another one that tries to access
the same floating IP object in db as disassociate_floatingips() method
does, we're locked and get db timeout.

We should avoid calling to notifier while under transaction.

To achieve this, I introduce a do_notify argument that controls whether
notification is done by disassociate_floatingips() itself or delegated
to caller. Callers that call to disassociate_floatingips() from under
transactions should handle notifications on their own. For this,
disassociate_floatingips() returns a set of routers that require
notification.

Updated drivers to reflect new behaviour. Added unit test.

Make ServerModeReader::parse handle the forceCMakeRun flag gracefully.

The problem there was two-fold:
1. The server would send a ""isReadyNow"" signal when its connection is
   estabilshed. This made the ServerModeReader trigger another parse run
   with the same parameters.

   That would in turn would force a new ServerMode process to be created.

2. The ""configure"" request that is sent races the new ServerMode
   process being connected.

Solve both issues by connecting a slot to the server-mode's
connected signal and have that do the right thing.

Update the MetaCompilation.Test project to run xunit.console.x86.exe on
F5.

xUnit is not able to load FakeSign'd assemblies when using shadow
copying. For running tests on the command line using BuildAndTest.proj
this is not a problem, as we can simply turn shadow copying off.
However, the Visual Studio xUnit runner *always* uses shadow copying,
and there does not seem to be any way to disable it. So instead this
commit updates MetaCompilation.Test to use the console runner, with
shadow copying disabled.

Unit tests will no longer show up in Test Explorer. To run tests, you
will now need to do the following:
1. Right-click on the MetaCompilation.Test project and select ""Set as
   Startup Project"".
2. Hit F5 to debug the unit tests (or Ctrl+F5 to run them without
   debugging).
3. A console window will open up and xUnit will start running the
   tests. When it finishes it waits for a keypress to give you a chance
   to review the list of failed tests, if any.

renesugar/arrow,053cd2354cfc6803d7961344672c13f78be8bd38,"ARROW-5512: [C++] Rough API skeleton for C++ Datasets API / framework

This is almost exclusively header files, so I caution all against debating small details like function signatures, names, or what kind of smart pointer to use (if any) in various places. Instead, does the high level structure seem reasonable (or at least, _not horrible_) as a starting point to do more work?

Some of the naming of things is inspired by related concepts in Apache Iceberg (incubating) (https://github.com/apache/incubator-iceberg), which is a vertically integrated dataset metastore and reading and writing system specialized for that metastore.

Here is the basic idea:

* A Dataset (for reading, aka ""scanning"") consists of a schema (what kind of data you expect to receive) and one or more data sources
* A DataSource abstractly yields an iterator of DataFragment
* A DataFragment represents a roughly individual storage unit, like a file

As many interfaces involving collections are based around Iterators so that we have the option of implementating ""lazy"" Datasets that continue to discover their structure after we are already scanning. It is a common problem in data warehousing that creating a detailed manifest of what needs to be scanned grows linearly in time with the complexity of the dataset (e.g. the number of fragments).

I abstracted away the file-related logic from the high level interface since I would like to support other kinds of data sources other than file-based ones:

* Flight streams: each endpoint from a DoGet operation in Flight corresponds to a DataFragment
* Database-like clients: e.g. the results of a SQL query form a Fragment

There's some object layering issues that aren't worked out yet, and I think the only way to work them out is to work on implementation and refactor until we get things feeling right:

* It is the job of a FileFormat implementation to translate between
* Filtering can occur both at the Partition/Fragment level (i.e. ""skip these files altogether"") as well as at the post-materialization stage. In Iceberg these ""post-materialization"" filters are called ""Residuals"". For example, if the user wants `filter1 & filter2` to be applied and only `filter1` can be handled by the low-level file deserialization, we will have to apply `filter2` against the unfiltered in-memory RecordBatch, returning the filtered RecordBatch to the user

As another matter, this objective of this framework is to draw a distinction between the Schema of a file and the Schema of the Dataset. This isn't reflected fully in the headers yet. To give an example, suppose that we wish to obtain a Dataset with schema

```
a: int64 nullable
b: double nullable
c: string nullable
```

When reading files in the Dataset, we might encounter fields are won't want, or fields that are missing. We must _conform_ the physical data to the Dataset's desired Schema. Much of the hard labor will be in the file format implementations, so match up what's in the file with what the Dataset wants. We also must deal with other kinds of schema normalization issues, like one Parquet file having a field as ""non-nullable"" when the desired schema is ""nullable"".

Inferring the Schema of a Dataset when you don't know it outright is a whole separate matter. If you go to Scan a dataset without knowing it, you must necessarily do some amount of inference up front or just prior to scanning. We will need to offer both ""low effort"" (look at some, but not files, and do not expend too much energy on it -- e.g. in the case of CSV files you may reach a conclusion without parsing an entire file) and ""high effort / exhaustive"" Schema inference.

As far as the actual Scan execution we are likely to immediately suffer some thread scheduling issues when trying to Scan files in parallel as internally IO and CPU work is coordinated. The file reader implementations have their own internal parallelism so that's something to contemplate as well.

In any case, I suggest we start small by creating minimalistic interfaces to CSV and Parquet files to start, implement simple dataset discovery as we have now in pyarrow/parquet.py, but a bit more general, and then we can investigate the various more advanced features as described in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bVhzifD38qDypnSjtf8exvpP3sSB5x_Kw9m-n66FB2c/edit piece by piece.

With this change, one lisp-gpe interface is created per vrf/overlay
tenant and its tx node is used as encapsulator (or tunnel ingress). For
all intents and purposes, the tx node inherits all functions previously
performed by the lisp-gpe-encap node and it maintains said node's
position in lisp-gpe's data-path graph. Chiefly, this opens the
possibility to chain interface features, like IPSec, transparently with
LISP. Furthermore, it brings basic data plane support for vrfs and LISP
instance-ids (or virtual network instances as per RFC7364).

Other changes include improvements to lisp-gpe enable and disable
sequences and corresponding API/VAT fixes.

Sorry for this being broken so long. =/

As part of this, switch all of the existing tests to be Little Endian,
which is the behavior I was asserting in them anyways! Add in a new
big-endian test that checks the interesting behavior there.

Another part of this is to tighten the rules abotu when we perform the
full-integer promotion. This logic now rejects cases where there fully
promoted integer is a non-multiple-of-8 bitwidth or cases where the
loads or stores touch bits which are in the allocated space of the
alloca but are not loaded or stored when accessing the integer. Sadly,
these aren't really observable today as the rest of the pass will
already ensure the invariants hold. However, the latter situation is
likely to become a potential concern in the future.

Thanks to Benjamin and Duncan for early review of this patch. I'm still
looking into whether there are further endianness issues, please let me
know if anyone sees BE failures persisting past this.

Originally we wanted to have a `Settings` object nested under the `Api`
namespace that looked and behaved just like the top-level `Settings`.

Furthermore, we enforced a nested style of class/module children so that
constants would not have to be fully qualified.

That turned out to be problematic. First, if the top-level `Settings`
was loaded before that of `Api`, the latter may never be loaded, meaning
that all those unqualified `Settings`' would point to the wrong object.

Second, we were using both `Api::Settings` and `::Settings` in the API
code, leading to confusing constructs such as:

```ruby
::Settings[Settings.base.module]
```

Since we want unqualified constants in the API code, it seemed
acceptable to introduce some redundancy in renaming `Api::Settings` to
`Api::ApiConfig`. Further, we preferred ""Config"" over ""Settings"" since
for the most part we refer to this thing as ""config"" everywhere
else (e.g. it's persisted in config/api.yml, methods such as
`api_config`, `CollectionConfig`, etc.)

Before, we had disabled gemini's logging completely, so if there was a
problem (such as: can't connect to the database and throws an exception
on startup) it wouldn't show up anywhere.  With this change, errors like
that should show up.

Starting resin with ""resinctl console"" instead of ""resinctl start"" means
the stdout from the gemini Java application will actually show up in
TFB's console output and get captured in the results directory.  Resin's
documentation suggests that ""start"" should be the mode used in
production, but that happens to be inconvenient for us in the context of
TFB since stdout is the only kind of logging we can depend on.  We're
asserting that there will be no difference in performance from ""console""
as opposed to ""start"".

I removed all the unused .conf files for Gemini.  In the remaining used
.conf file, I enabled logging to stdout and changed the log threshold to
the recommended value.  I removed the ""RequestLog*"" settings because that
feature was removed from gemini.

I removed the Eclipse project files and the setup.sh script because those
aren't required by TFB.  They're leftovers from the original gemini
project generator and we don't intend for anyone to actually use them, if
they even still work.",,,,,,

Summary:
lspCommand needs to know when the server died - was that death from one of a small number of known whitelisted reasons that merit an automatic restart? or was it for some other reason that doesn't?

D5798983 introduced Prot.ServerExit, sent from server to client (via monitor) from inside rechecker.ml for the cases where the server is about to die.

But that had race conditions - what if the server sends that message to monitor, and dies, and monitor sees that the server has died and so dies itself BEFORE it forwards the message on to the client?

D7616745 fixed the race by making the monitor be the party responsible for catching the server's exit code and sending that on to the client, and then closing the connection to the client. It was therefore able to remove the code in sender which sent that Prot.ServerExit message.

Except it didn't quite clean up all the way. This diff removes the last remaining place where server attempts to send the Prot.ServerExit message.

GCE provider: Limit Filter calls to regexps rather than insane blobs

Filters can't exceed 4k, and GET requests against the GCE API are also limited, so these break down in different ways at different cluster counts. Fix it by introducing an advisory `node-instance-prefix` configuration in the GCE provider that can hint the `EnsureLoadBalancer`/`UpdateLoadBalancer code` (and the firewall creation/update code). If it's not there, or wrong (a hostname that's registered violates it), just ignore it and grab the whole project.

Previously, in `PythonBinary`, `getInputsToCompareToOutput()` returned an empty list
and the cache information added by the `PythonPackageComponents` field did not contribute

to the `RuleKey` (only file names), which meant that re-running a `python_test()` after
changing its code would have no effect because it the `RuleKey` would be unchanged and
the result (positive or negative) would simply be returned from the cache.

Test Plan:
Ran `buck build --keep-going <python-test-rule>` and verified that changing the source
of the test and running it again would show `BUILT_LOCALLY` instead of `MATCHING_RULE_KEY`.

Adding IKS functionality to kubemark

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
This PR adds bash scripts in which kubemark is able to be run on IKS clusters. This adds versatility to the testing ability of kubemark by adding another cloud provider and example of use. The scripts to clean up kubemark after use are also included. In addition to this, minor changes were added to other kubemark related files to increase cloud-provider flexibility.

**Which issue(s) this PR fixes** *(optional, in `fixes #<issue number>(, fixes #<issue_number>, ...)` format, will close the issue(s) when PR gets merged)*:
No issues will be fixed, as this is an extension to a feature.

**Special notes for your reviewer**:
I currently have the IKS scripts separate from the default ones, which are mainly based off of GCE. If it is preferable, I could combine them into single scripts which prompt the user to choose which cloud provider to test. If there are any issues with the scripts or code, please let me know. Thank you!

Disable the grace termination period for the calico/node pod

Disable the termination grace period for the calico/node add-on DaemonSet.  The grace period is unnecessary for calico/node and it delays restart of a new calico/node pod to take over routing and policy updates.

IgorMinar/angular,ca1c430f30127c1abb061fba585b45195d5b62e5,"fix(compiler-cli): ngtsc shim files not being generated on case-insensitive platforms (#27466)

Common insensitive platforms are `win32/win64` (see:
[here](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/3e4c5c95abd515eb9713b881d27ab3a93cc00461/src/compiler/sys.ts#L681-L682))

Currently when running `bazel build packages/core --define=compile=aot`, the `compiler-cli` will throw because it cannot find the `index.ngfactory.ts` file in the compiler host. This is because the shim host wrapper is not properly generating the requested `ngfactory` file.

This happens because we call `getCanonicalFileName` that returns a path that is different to the actual program filenames that are used to construct a map of generated files. Since the generators always use the paths which are not ""canonical"" and pases them internally like that, we can just stop manually calling `getCanonicalFileName`.

BUGFIX: Remove role check when deleting workspaces for users

This was broken by 5279a7489efcd3c5f5e411b6b5bda11ad1b4ca75.
Before, checks were done for the role TYPO3.Neos:Editor. However,
checking for AbstractEditor is pointless; workspaces are
now never deleted when a user is deleted. Since the deletePersonalWorkspace
method checks for existence anyway, there's no reason to do
this role check at all. If a user is deleted, their workspaces should be
deleted as well.

when gflags is absent, due to a compatiblity layer:

We do not want a 3rd party dependency on the host to be picked up

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

This PR consists of the `test` components of #23665 only, minus the associated patch from that PR.

It adds a new unit test to `JsonSuite` which verifies that the `count()` returned from a `DataFrame` loaded from JSON containing empty lines does not include those empty lines in the record count. The test runs `count` prior to otherwise reading data from the `DataFrame`, so as to catch future cases where a pre-parsing optimization might result in `count` results inconsistent with existing behavior.

This PR is intended to be deployed alongside #23667; `master` currently causes the test to fail, as described in [SPARK-26745](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-26745).

## How was this patch tested?

Manual testing, existing `JsonSuite` unit tests.

Closes #23674 from sumitsu/json_emptyline_count_test.

Revert ""certs: only append locally discovered addresses when we got none from the cloudprovider""

This reverts commit 7354bbe5ac838af560ca5dbabcd7d05e28ef8f59.

https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61869 caused a mismatch between the requested CSR and the addresses in node status.

Instead of computing addresses in two places, the cert manager should derive its CSR request from the addresses in node status. This would enable the kubelet to react to address changes, as well as be driven by an external cloud provider.

Enabling ARCH_ROMGETC assumes that for the target architecture

The solution is to add upper-level option, which can be selected

crobinso/libvirt,a20c3aafbe501cc1756341e82d33728a4d9c5b8f,"qemu: refactor blockinfo job handling

In order for a future patch to virDomainListGetStats to reuse
some code for determining disk usage of offline domains, we
need to make it easier to pull out part of the guts of grabbing
blockinfo.  The current implementation grabs a job fairly late
in the game, while getstats will already own a job; reordering
things so that the job is always grabbed up front in both
functions will make it easier to pull out the common code.
This patch results in grabbing a job in cases where one was not
previously needed, but as it is a query job, it should not be
noticeably slower.

This patch touches the same code as the fix for CVE-2014-6458
(commit b799259); in that patch, we avoided hotplug changing
a disk reference during the time of obtaining a monitor lock
by copying all data we needed and no longer referencing disk;
this patch goes the other way and ensures that by holding the
job, the disk cannot be changed so we no longer need to worry
about the disk being invalidated across the monitor lock.

* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c (qemuDomainGetBlockInfo): Rearrange job
control to be outside of disk information.

Automatic merge from submit-queue (batch tested with PRs 39115, 39111)

Node E2E: Do not use sudo when untar node e2e tar ball.

`sudo tar -x` will [extract files with original file ownership](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/264464/sudo-tar-changes-extracted-files-ownership-to-unknown-user), which is not what we want.
This also causes problem to https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/1348.

Because in https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/1348 we move node e2e runner into a docker container. Inside the container, the user is `root` by default, so the tar ball has `root` ownership.

If we untar the tar ball with `sudo`, it will recover the `root` ownership and the following operation may not have enough permission.

No matter what, we should not recover the file ownership inside the tar ball because:
* We don't care it.
* It may even not exist on the host.

Pull request description:

  This PR makes `bench_bitcoin -evals=0` evaluate at once and throws when `-evals` is a negative integer.

  ---

  Currently when you run `bench_bitcoin -evals=0`, it'll get stuck at
  ```
  # Benchmark, evals, iterations, total, min, max, median
  ```
  . This is not intuitively expected and should instead evaluate instantly as it's set to zero. Negative integers for `-evals` does not make sense either and should throw if set.

The snap --prepare-image command will currently look into the
gadget and create a /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg configuration if the
gadget contains a ""cloud.conf"" file in cloud-init format. But
even if there is no such file an empty /etc/cloud directory is
created.

This empty directory ends up on /writable/system-data/etc/cloud
and that will block the initial boot from populating that dir
with the data from the core18 /etc/cloud directory when this
dir is in ""transition"" mode in the /etc/system-image/writable-paths.

As a first step we should not create this /etc/cloud directory if
there is nothing in it. This means we will be able to revert:
snapcore/core18#106

Once that is done we need to also support ds-identify.conf or
switch to a cloud.conf/ directory instead of the current file
only approach. The reason is that we do not want to merge the
cloud config from core18 and from the gadget as this is messy.
Instead it should either come from the gadget or from the core18.",,,,,,

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

The sample weight testing for logistic regressions is not robust. Logistic regression suite already has many test cases comparing results to R glmnet. Since both libraries support sample weights, we should use sample weights in the test to increase coverage for sample weighting. This patch doesn't really add any code and makes the testing more complete.

Also fixed some errors with the R code that was referenced in the test suit. Changed `standardization=T` to `standardize=T` since the former is invalid.

7a8c251901 made this logic hard to follow. After that change, messages would
not be sent to a peer via SendMessages() before the handshake was complete, but
messages could still be sent as a response to an incoming message.

For example, if a peer had not yet sent a verack, we wouldn't notify it about
new blocks, but we would respond to a PING with a PONG.

This change makes the behavior straightforward: until we've received a verack,
never send any message other than version/verack/reject.

The behavior until a VERACK is received has always been undefined, this change
just tightens our policy.

This also makes testing much easier, because we can now connect but not send

The appup instruction 'delete_module' would cause a crash during
upgrade if the module to be deleted was not loaded. The reason was
that the release_handler tried to read the version number of the old
module after the code path had changed to point to the new version of
the application. Thus, if the module had not been loaded before the
upgrade, there would no longer be any such module in the path
(delete_module indicates that the module is deleted from the new
version of the application).

This is corrected by letting the release_handler read the old version
of the module only if the module is updated - not if it is
removed. And it is always read before the code path is changed.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

`OrcFilters.createBuilder` has exponential complexity in the height of the filter tree due to the way the check-and-build pattern is implemented. We've hit this in production by passing a `Column` filter to Spark directly, with a job taking multiple hours for a simple set of ~30 filters. This PR changes the checking logic so that the conversion has linear complexity in the size of the tree instead of exponential in its height.

Right now, due to the way ORC `SearchArgument` works, the code is forced to do two separate phases when converting a given Spark filter to an ORC filter:
1. Check if the filter is convertible.
2. Only if the check in 1. succeeds, perform the actual conversion into the resulting ORC filter.

However, there's one detail which is the culprit in the exponential complexity: phases 1. and 2. are both done using the exact same method. The resulting exponential complexity is easiest to see in the `NOT` case - consider the following code:

```
val f1 = col(""id"") === lit(5)
val f2 = !f1
val f3 = !f2
val f4 = !f3
val f5 = !f4
```

Now, when we run `createBuilder` on `f5`, we get the following behaviour:
1. call `createBuilder(f4)` to check if the child `f4` is convertible
2. call `createBuilder(f4)` to actually convert it

This seems fine when looking at a single level, but what actually ends up happening is:
- `createBuilder(f3)` will then recursively be called 4 times - 2 times in step 1., and two times in step 2.
- `createBuilder(f2)` will be called 8 times - 4 times in each top-level step, 2 times in each sub-step.
- `createBuilder(f1)` will be called 16 times.

As a result, having a tree of height > 30 leads to billions of calls to `createBuilder`, heap allocations, and so on and can take multiple hours.

The way this PR solves this problem is by separating the `check` and `convert` functionalities into separate functions. This way, the call to `createBuilder` on `f5` above would look like this:
1. call `isConvertible(f4)` to check if the child `f4` is convertible - amortized constant complexity
2. call `createBuilder(f4)` to actually convert it - linear complexity in the size of the subtree.

This way, we get an overall complexity that's linear in the size of the filter tree, allowing us to convert tree with 10s of thousands of nodes in milliseconds.

The reason this split (`check` and `build`) is possible is that the checking never actually depends on the actual building of the filter. The `check` part of `createBuilder` depends mainly on:
- `isSearchableType` for leaf nodes, and
- `check`-ing the child filters for composite nodes like NOT, AND and OR.
Situations like the `SearchArgumentBuilder` throwing an exception while building the resulting ORC filter are not handled right now - they just get thrown out of the class, and this change preserves this behaviour.

This PR extracts this part of the code to a separate class which allows the conversion to make very efficient checks to confirm that a given child is convertible before actually converting it.

Results:
Before:
- converting a skewed tree with a height of ~35 took about 6-7 hours.
- converting a skewed tree with hundreds or thousands of nodes would be completely impossible.

Now:
- filtering against a skewed tree with a height of 1500 in the benchmark suite finishes in less than 10 seconds.

## Steps to reproduce
```scala
val schema = StructType.fromDDL(""col INT"")
(20 to 30).foreach { width =>
  val whereFilter = (1 to width).map(i => EqualTo(""col"", i)).reduceLeft(Or)
  val start = System.currentTimeMillis()
  OrcFilters.createFilter(schema, Seq(whereFilter))
  println(s""With $width filters, conversion takes ${System.currentTimeMillis() - start} ms"")
}
```

### Before this PR
```
With 20 filters, conversion takes 363 ms
With 21 filters, conversion takes 496 ms
With 22 filters, conversion takes 939 ms

With 24 filters, conversion takes 3756 ms
With 25 filters, conversion takes 7452 ms
With 26 filters, conversion takes 14978 ms
With 27 filters, conversion takes 30519 ms
With 28 filters, conversion takes 60361 ms // 1 minute
With 29 filters, conversion takes 126575 ms // 2 minutes 6 seconds
With 30 filters, conversion takes 257369 ms // 4 minutes 17 seconds
```

### After this PR

With 21 filters, conversion takes 0 ms
With 22 filters, conversion takes 1 ms
With 23 filters, conversion takes 0 ms
With 24 filters, conversion takes 1 ms
With 25 filters, conversion takes 1 ms

With 27 filters, conversion takes 1 ms
With 28 filters, conversion takes 0 ms
With 29 filters, conversion takes 1 ms
With 30 filters, conversion takes 0 ms
```

## How was this patch tested?

There are no changes in behaviour, and the existing tests pass. Added new benchmarks that expose the problematic behaviour and they finish quickly with the changes applied.

Closes #24068 from IvanVergiliev/optimize-orc-filters.

Add log messages that will help debug the behavior of `TreeInode::diff()`

I added this since I saw a case where `getScmStatus()` was returning a file as
modified when it did not appear to have mode or contents changes.
Unfortunately we did not have any existing debug log messages for this, and the
problem went away after restarting edenfs, so I wasn't able to track it down.

Allow browsing branches that end with '.atom'

## What does this MR do?

1. Simplify the regex capture in the routing for the CommitsController
   to not exclude the '.atom' suffix. That's a perfectly valid git
   branch name, so we shouldn't blow up if we get it.
2. Because Rails now can't automatically detect the request format, add
   some code to do so in `ExtractPath` when there is no path. This means
   that, given branches 'foo' and 'foo.atom', the Atom feed for the
   former is unroutable. To fix this: don't do that! Give the branches
   different names!

## Why was this MR needed?

Creating a branch or tag name ending in '.atom' would cause some 500s on that repo.

## What are the relevant issue numbers?

Closes #21955. Related to !5994.

45bf523 Optimize autoload prefix in composer.json

Discussion
----------

Optimize autoload prefix in composer.json

By having more specific autoload prefixes it is possible to reduce the
number of stat calls made. Also it prevents conflicts with similar
namespaces.

See ref: https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/commit/e58c6cdbf50dd06b71e76a413fb870c95ab22bf5

SessionHandlerInterface is left intentionally.

@Seldaek Is this true? And if so shouldn't this be optimized in Composer it self?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2012-09-28T08:48:05Z

@sstok I cannot be optimized in Composer itself. It already optimize things by putting most specific prefixes first.
Composer matches a prefix. The most specific the prefix is, the better (as it is less likely to match other classes).

For components, it is quite useless as we don't have component with a name being a prefix for the name of another one.
For the main package, it can indeed optimize things if someone was using ``Symfony_`` in an old-way package. This is not likely as there is no reason to have some new Symfony code using the PHP 5.2 naming and symfony1 was not using PSR-0. but it is indeed a working solution.

This was occuring in Zend Framework as using ``Zend`` for the namespace prefix of ZF2 would match when loading ``Zend_Registry`` (and this was causing issues when using ZF1 and ZF2 together as the PSR-0 path for ``Zend_Registry`` or ``Zend\Registry`` would be the same, thus loading the wrong file)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Slamdunk at 2012-09-28T09:04:17Z

I know the main reason occurred in ZF doesn't happen in Symfony, but I see only benefits for taking it even so.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?
A Generate with the `outer` flag enabled should always return one or more rows for every input row. The optimizer currently violates this by rewriting `outer` Generates that do not contain columns of the child plan into an unjoined generate, for example:
```sql
select e from a lateral view outer explode(a.b) as e
```
The result of this is that `outer` Generate does not produce output at all when the Generators' input expression is empty. This PR fixes this.

## How was this patch tested?
Added test case to `SQLQuerySuite`.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

This patch adds a new property called `spark.secret.redactionPattern` that
allows users to specify a scala regex to decide which Spark configuration
properties and environment variables in driver and executor environments
contain sensitive information. When this regex matches the property or
environment variable name, its value is redacted from the environment UI and
various logs like YARN and event logs.

This change uses this property to redact information from event logs and YARN
logs. It also, updates the UI code to adhere to this property instead of
hardcoding the logic to decipher which properties are sensitive.

Here's an image of the UI post-redaction:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1709451/20506215/4cc30654-b007-11e6-8aee-4cde253fba2f.png)

Here's the text in the YARN logs, post-redaction:
``HADOOP_CREDSTORE_PASSWORD -> *********(redacted)``

Here's the text in the event logs, post-redaction:
``...,""spark.executorEnv.HADOOP_CREDSTORE_PASSWORD"":""*********(redacted)"",""spark.yarn.appMasterEnv.HADOOP_CREDSTORE_PASSWORD"":""*********(redacted)"",...``

## How was this patch tested?
1. Unit tests are added to ensure that redaction works.
2. A YARN job reading data off of S3 with confidential information
(hadoop credential provider password) being provided in the environment
variables of driver and executor. And, afterwards, logs were grepped to make
sure that no mention of secret password was present. It was also ensure that
the job was able to read the data off of S3 correctly, thereby ensuring that
the sensitive information was being trickled down to the right places to read
the data.
3. The event logs were checked to make sure no mention of secret password was
present.
4. UI environment tab was checked to make sure there was no secret information
being displayed.

### What changes were proposed in this pull request?

Add ShowCreateTableStatement and make SHOW CREATE TABLE go through the same catalog/table resolution framework of v2 commands.

### Why are the changes needed?

It's important to make all the commands have the same table resolution behavior, to avoid confusing end-users. e.g.

```
USE my_catalog
DESC t // success and describe the table t from my_catalog
SHOW CREATE TABLE t // report table not found as there is no table t in the session catalog
```

### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?

yes. When running SHOW CREATE TABLE, Spark fails the command if the current catalog is set to a v2 catalog, or the table name specified a v2 catalog.

### How was this patch tested?

Unit tests.

*** Reason for rollback ***

Forgot to send this for readability review.

*** Original change description ***

Add ""create_cdns_tld"" command to nomulus

Add a command to allow us to create the managed zone for a new TLD in cloud
dns.

Note: this implementation is problematic, it's currently doing its own thing
as far as credentials and http transport, making it unusable with the []
channel and the credentials generated by login.  Unfortunately, fixing the
plumbing to make it work right is difficult, and we have an immediate need for
this functionality.

Motivation:

The ndots = 0 is a valid value for ndots, it means that when using a non dotted name, the resolution should first try using a search and if it fails then use subdomains. Currently it is not allowed. Docker compose uses this when wiring up containers as names have usually no dots inside.

Modification:

Modify DnsNameResolver to accept ndots = 0 and handle the case in the resolution procedure. In this case a direct search is done and then a fallback on the search path is performed.

Result:

The ndots = 0 case is implemented.

Khan/phabricator,a40c40fade6a2b6989192a48b0f2e14ecfde3357,"Drive query ordering and paging more cohesively

Summary:
Ref T7803. Ordering and paging are inherently intertwined, but they often aren't driven by the same data right now.

Start driving them through the same data:

  - `getOrderableColumns()` defines orderable and pageable columns.
  - `getPagingValueMap()` reads values from a cursor.

This is generally sufficient to implement both paging and ordering.

Also, add some more sanity checks to try to curtail the number of ambiguous/invalid orderings applications produce, since these cause subtle/messy bugs.

Test Plan:
  - Paged through pastes and a few other object types.
  - Intentionally changed defaults to be invalid and hit some of the errors.

GNOME/mutter,704cae1de3808e0af4493c4a05cf2c9b75fce340,"backend: Use the most recent event time on replayed touch events

When a touch sequence is passively grabbed and later rejected, events
will be replayed on the next client in propagation order, although those
events (either transformed to pointer events or not) will contain the
original timestamps, this will make grabs fail with InvalidTime if triggered
from the replayed ButtonPress/TouchBegin handler.

In order to work around this, store the most recent event time (presumably
gotten from the XI_TouchEnd caused by the passive grab being rejected), and
use that time on the events being replayed afterwards and grabs, so we don't
possibly fail with InvalidTime if those events result in a compositor grab.

This PR replaces #11456. It adds a ""label_format"" option which allows to configure a format for generating labels. Two placeholders are available: `%name%` and `%id%`.

**Feedback wanted**: Should we change the placeholders to `{{ name }}` and `{{ id }}`?

The option is inherited from the parent form if not set explicitly on a field:

```php
$form = $this->createForm('myform', $data, array('label_format' => 'form.label.%id%'));
```

Follow-up PR: Make the default label format and translation domain configurable in config.yml.

3610: Improve Cashbox Report r=mbayopanda a=jniles

This PR improves the cashbox report in the following ways:
 1. The dates (from - to) are now respected in the search query.
 2. The currencies are rendered in the correct cashbox currency.
 3. We include a real opening balance and closing balance.
 4. The user can identify the difference between posted and unposted records via italics applied to unposted records.

We've also centralized the `getAccountTransactions()` call used between multiple reports into a single shared file `accounts/transactions`.  We've also rewritten the query for the combined posting_journal and general_ledger such that the WHERE statement is executed in subqueries, greatly improving the performance of the combined query.

Finally, the `getAccountTransactions()` function now sorts first based on `created_at` date, then on `trans_date`.  This makes back-dated transactions show up later in the rendering.  For example, users frequently back-date the transfer from the cashbox into the main coffre, and it makes sense to show these at the bottom of the report.

Closes #3595.

necessary Config.in.legacy handling.

Since those options are part of a choice, the legacy handling cannot

When rewriting stable-status.txt, which happens on each build, avoid updating
the file's ctime and mtime if the new contents match what is already in the
file.

This prevents tickling the TimestampGranularityMonitor for what should be a
no-op update, which in turn could cause null/incremental builds to stall for
up to a second.  The problem was magnified on macOS where the default HFS+
file system only has second-level granularity.  (This also affects Linux, but
because current Linux file systems have milli/nanosecond-level granularity,
the wait imposed by TimestampGranularityMonitor is minimal and thus not
generally noticeable.)

StreamingContext.start() can throw exception because DStream.validateAtStart() fails (say, checkpoint directory not set for StateDStream). But by then JobScheduler, JobGenerator, and ReceiverTracker has already started, along with their actors. But those cannot be shutdown because the only way to do that is call StreamingContext.stop() which cannot be called as the context has not been marked as ACTIVE.

Override core.commentChar with our special ""\u0001"". Given that it is highly improbably that a line in a commit message starts with this symbol, this allows to treat it as a comment.

This allows to fix 3 issues:
* IDEA-176455 and IDEA-175443: Don't loose lines starting with a hash (the hash is not a comment char anymore).
* IDEA-140568: Ignore lines, passed to the Git interactive rebase dialog, which start with a redefined commentChar (we redefine it again to \u0001 and ignore lines starting with that specific symbol).
* Don't show Git helping text in reword/squash dialogs (again by ignoring lines starting with \u0001).

All issues remain in the very rare case, when a meaningful line starts with \u0001, but it was decided to ignore this issue until reported. If we need to fix it further, the ""cleanup=whitespace"" configuration option can be used to keep the lines starting with \u0001 (Git won't stripe them out on commit), but a more intelligent parsing will be needed to show these lines in the reword/squash dialog.

das-labor/radare2,722c62827b65d297924a6866501fd85df4a5b0a7,"Major rework to the native debugger (esp on Linux) (#5185)

The major contribution here is completely re-worked breakpoint hit/recoil
handling. This work fixes #4907 and lays the ground work for future native
debugger improvements (multi-threading, etc).

* Give a human friendly type to enums
* Change many wait functions to return RDebugReasonType
* Better return checking (from r_debug_reg_sync, r_bp_restore)
* Optimized register synchronization
* Lots of comments and whitespace changes
* Improved inferior death detection

Handle EXIT_PID events differently than DEAD process events

* Move breakpoint/recoil handling to wait/cont/step

Rather than handing breakpoint related things inside cmd_debug.c, do that
inside the r_debug API functions. This seems like the most logical place for it
to live since it should apply to just about any platform/architecture.  This
also centralizes calling into ""cmd.bp"" handling via the CoreBind callback.

* Track how the caller wishes to continue

It turns out that handling break point recoils is very complicated. The ptrace
API on Linux returns SIGTRAP for just about every type of operation (not just
breakpoints getting hit). Add the ""recoil_mode"" flag to indicate whether we are
single-stepping or continuing and whether or not we are inside the recoil.

* Proper handling for swstep=true

Since r_debug_step_soft calls r_debug_continue, it's already hitting the recoil
case there. Move the recoil handling from r_debug_step to r_debug_step_hard
only.

For the swstep=true case, special handling is required inside r_debug_recoil.
By resetting all of the breakpoints except the one we just hit, we ensure we
can step the original instruction and hit the new swstep breakpoint. Add a new
bp function called r_bp_restore_except to do this.

To make matters worse, we cannot use a BreakpointItem pointer because that
leads to a use-after-free condition. Instead, we the breakpoint address
instead.

Now breakpoints should work regardless of the swtep setting.

* Always call the recoil before continuing

Some callers of r_debug_continue might not have ever inserted any breakpoints
before. If we don't restore breakpoints before each call to the underlying
continue we won't hit them.

* Hide software step breakpoint events from the user

When a breakpoint even happens due to a software-step, hide it from the user.
They aren't really breakpoints as far as they are concerned.

* Improve process exit handling on Linux

There are three types of process exiting events on Linux:

1. PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT occurs just before a process exits. It's not possible to
prevent it from exiting, but it can be used to inspect the pre-exit state.
2. The process can exit for a variety of reasons and we can notice when we call
waitpid(2).
3. The process could die randomly on us :-/

On Windows, h->wait will return R_DEBUG_REASON_EXIT_PID, but it's more likely
on Linux to find out the process is already dead.

* Check more bits within waitpid status

We can often make a decision about what happened strictly by looking at the
status returned from waitpid. In other cases, we need to call
r_debug_handle_signals.

If we reach the end of this function without knowing what happened, consider it
an error.",,,,,,
mhei/openwrt,7c8c3226dc8ecd2b77d1d1e8215e0fbb52819cd7,"build: copy contents of 'src' folder to build dirs (if present)

The normal Prepare step for a build is unpack, apply patches.
But for certain packages, patches contain whole files, which
would be nice to have separately and copied over as a last step
in the Prepare phase.

We need it for some other packages + patches, but I think
the 'hostapd' package can be used as a test for this.

As a quick note:
the reason the condition is being evaluated as
`[ ! -d ./src/ ] || $(CP) ./src/* $(HOST_BUILD_DIR)`
and not with
`[ -d ./src/ ] && $(CP) ./src/* $(HOST_BUILD_DIR)`
is that the latter would translate in a build failure if the `src`
folder is not present (the exit code would be 1).
The first one, succeeds for both cases (if `src` present or not).

kubectl binary plugins

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

Introduces the ability to extend `kubectl` by adding third-party plugins that will be exposed through `kubectl`.

Plugins are executable commands written in any language. To be included as a plugin, a binary or script file has to

1. be located under one of the supported plugin path locations:
1.1 `~/.kubectl/plugins` dir
1.2. one or more directory set in the `KUBECTL_PLUGINS_PATH` env var
1.3. the `kubectl/plugins` dir under one or more directory set in the `XDG_DATA_DIRS` env var, which defaults to `/usr/local/share:/usr/share`
2. in any of the plugin path above, have a subfolder with the plugin file(s)
3. in the subfolder, contain at least a `plugin.yaml` file that describes the plugin

Example:

```
$ cat ~/.kube/plugins/myplugin/plugin.yaml
name: ""myplugin""
shortDesc: ""My plugin's short description""
command: ""echo Hello plugins!""

$ kubectl myplugin
Hello plugins!
```

~~In case the plugin declares `tunnel: true`, the plugin engine will pass the `KUBECTL_PLUGIN_API_HOST` env var when calling the plugin binary. Plugins can then access the Kube REST API in ""http://$KUBECTL_PLUGIN_API_HOST/api"" using the same context currently in use by `kubectl`.~~

Test plugins are provided in `pkg/kubectl/plugins/examples`. Just copy (or symlink) the files to `~/.kube/plugins` to test.

**Which issue this PR fixes**:

Related to the discussions in the proposal document: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/30086 and https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/122.

The problem is with GetBytes(char*, int, byte*, int) -- we needed to override this method in order to avoid buffer allocation. But the base method is currently not exposed in portable profile.
We don't actually need to define an ecnoding to serialize strings. We can serialize strings to byte array manually and then write the bytes direaction to the strream.

Taking it one step furtehr we can also avoid using a custom string serialization format as well. Instead we chack if the string being serialized is UTF8-encodable. We already have a helper in MetadataHelpers that answers that question. If it is we use UTF8 encoding, otherwise we use UTF16 encoding. Invalid Unicode characters are rare so we don't need to optimize the latter. (changeset 1267243)

Automatic merge from submit-queue

Add PKCE support to oc

This change updates RequestToken to support an OAuth code flow along with the existing token flow.  The code flow is set as the default.  RequestToken also performs a check against the server's OAuth metadata endpoint.  If the server supports PKCE with S256 (which all recent versions of OpenShift do), than RequestToken includes PKCE data to strengthen the code flow since we must use a public OAuth client with oc.  Care was taken to preserve the existing behavior of following redirects that are part of the challenge flow (an authenticating proxy for example) while acting on redirects that are instead part of the OAuth flow (exchanging the code for an access token).  The use of all OAuth URL constants was consolidated into a single location to guarantee they are used correctly.

This (and other debug code I added but then removed because it should

using a Semaphore in stopBranch().

So instead of using a Sempahore, use an AtomicReference (like the
legacy spawn scheduler does) to track the strategy that was able to
run the stopBranch code. This also avoid having to worry about
the strategies doing the right thing regarding the interrupt bit
status. (I'm now more convinced that they do the right thing.)

Revert ""certs: only append locally discovered addresses when we got none from the cloudprovider""

This reverts commit 7354bbe5ac838af560ca5dbabcd7d05e28ef8f59.

https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/61869 caused a mismatch between the requested CSR and the addresses in node status.

Instead of computing addresses in two places, the cert manager should derive its CSR request from the addresses in node status. This would enable the kubelet to react to address changes, as well as be driven by an external cloud provider.

explora26/zephyr,7ecc359f2cb87951a18bdc5f62b348990340833f,"userspace: do not auto-cleanup static objects

Dynamic kernel objects enforce that the permission state
of an object is also a reference count; using a kernel
object without permission regardless of caller privilege
level is a programming bug.

However, this is not the case for static objects. In
particular, supervisor threads are allowed to use any
object they like without worrying about permissions, and
the logic here was causing cleanup functions to be called
over and over again on kernel objects that were actually
in use.

The automatic cleanup mechanism was intended for
dynamic objects anyway, so just skip it entirely for
static objects.

This is a workaround to prevent the whole build from failing because of
the intree kmods are not supported yet by upstream project.

Root cause is that kernel version should not play a part when making

different kernel versions.

One less than ideal effect of this change is that for an unsupported
kernel version, people can still select the intree kmod but it won't be
built.  This may contradict expectation if the warning was not noticed
by them

We ran into problems with all the /etc/hotplug.d/ scripts that sleep for
the sysfs files or for other reasons. Anyway, it takes much too much time
before udev is executed.
HAL has its own notifier in /etc/hotplug.d/ and also waits for the
dev.d/events with the same SEQNUM. Sometimes it take 25 seconds between
these two events, cause the other scripts are sleeping too much :)

Attached is a patch that installs the udevsend symlink as
10-udev.hotplug instead of udev.hotplug, to be executed earlier.

The virtue of the comment strategy was that the parser did all the work of
maintaining the boundaries between markup chunks, using comments as the
boundary markers.  The new strategy (of tagging the first node with a
special attribute) has a similar virtue, since the parser should preserve
that attribute only for the nodes we care about, and any rendered nodes

As requested in [SPARK-4923](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-4923), I've provided a rough DeveloperApi for the repl. I've only done this for Scala 2.10 because it does not appear that Scala 2.11 is implemented. The Scala 2.11 repl still has the old `scala.tools.nsc` package and the SparkIMain does not appear to have the class server needed for shipping code over (unless this functionality has been moved elsewhere?). I also left alone the `ExecutorClassLoader` and `ConstructorCleaner` as I have no experience working with those classes.

This marks the majority of methods in `SparkIMain` as _private_ with a few special cases being _private[repl]_ as other classes within the same package access them. Any public method has been marked with `DeveloperApi` as suggested by pwendell and I took the liberty of writing up a Scaladoc for each one to further elaborate their usage.

As the Scala 2.11 REPL [conforms]((https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2206)) to [JSR-223](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/scripting/), the [Spark Kernel](https://github.com/ibm-et/spark-kernel) uses the SparkIMain of Scala 2.10 in the same manner. So, I've taken care to expose methods predominately related to necessary functionality towards a JSR-223 scripting engine implementation.

1. The ability to _get_ variables from the interpreter (and other information like class/symbol/type)
2. The ability to _put_ variables into the interpreter
3. The ability to _compile_ code
4. The ability to _execute_ code
5. The ability to get contextual information regarding the scripting environment

Additional functionality that I marked as exposed included the following:

1. The blocking initialization method (needed to actually start SparkIMain instance)
2. The class server uri (needed to set the _spark.repl.class.uri_ property after initialization), reduced from the entire class server
3. The class output directory (beneficial for tools like ours that need to inspect and use the directory where class files are served)
4. Suppression (quiet/silence) mechanics for output
5. Ability to add a jar to the compile/runtime classpath
6. The reset/close functionality
7. Metric information (last variable assignment, ""needed"" for extracting results from last execution, real variable name for better debugging)
8. Execution wrapper (useful to have, but debatable)

Aside from `SparkIMain`, I updated other classes/traits and their methods in the _repl_ package to be private/package protected where possible. A few odd cases (like the SparkHelper being in the scala.tools.nsc package to expose a private variable) still exist, but I did my best at labelling them.

`SparkCommandLine` has proven useful to extract settings and `SparkJLineCompletion` has proven to be useful in implementing auto-completion in the [Spark Kernel](https://github.com/ibm-et/spark-kernel) project. Other than those - and `SparkIMain` - my experience has yielded that other classes/methods are not necessary for interactive applications taking advantage of the REPL API.

Tested via the following:

    $ export MAVEN_OPTS=""-Xmx2g -XX:MaxPermSize=512M -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=512m""
    $ mvn -Phadoop-2.3 -DskipTests clean package && mvn -Phadoop-2.3 test

Also did a quick verification that I could start the shell and execute some code:

    $ ./bin/spark-shell
    ...

    scala> val x = 3
    x: Int = 3

    scala> sc.parallelize(1 to 10).reduce(_+_)
    ...
    res1: Int = 55

aosagie/spark,a5dcb82b5a6b08ebfe168e735f6edb40b80420fd,"[SPARK-27105][SQL] Optimize away exponential complexity in ORC predicate conversion

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

`OrcFilters.createBuilder` has exponential complexity in the height of the filter tree due to the way the check-and-build pattern is implemented. We've hit this in production by passing a `Column` filter to Spark directly, with a job taking multiple hours for a simple set of ~30 filters. This PR changes the checking logic so that the conversion has linear complexity in the size of the tree instead of exponential in its height.

Right now, due to the way ORC `SearchArgument` works, the code is forced to do two separate phases when converting a given Spark filter to an ORC filter:
1. Check if the filter is convertible.
2. Only if the check in 1. succeeds, perform the actual conversion into the resulting ORC filter.

However, there's one detail which is the culprit in the exponential complexity: phases 1. and 2. are both done using the exact same method. The resulting exponential complexity is easiest to see in the `NOT` case - consider the following code:

```
val f1 = col(""id"") === lit(5)
val f2 = !f1
val f3 = !f2
val f4 = !f3
val f5 = !f4
```

Now, when we run `createBuilder` on `f5`, we get the following behaviour:
1. call `createBuilder(f4)` to check if the child `f4` is convertible
2. call `createBuilder(f4)` to actually convert it

This seems fine when looking at a single level, but what actually ends up happening is:
- `createBuilder(f3)` will then recursively be called 4 times - 2 times in step 1., and two times in step 2.
- `createBuilder(f2)` will be called 8 times - 4 times in each top-level step, 2 times in each sub-step.
- `createBuilder(f1)` will be called 16 times.

As a result, having a tree of height > 30 leads to billions of calls to `createBuilder`, heap allocations, and so on and can take multiple hours.

The way this PR solves this problem is by separating the `check` and `convert` functionalities into separate functions. This way, the call to `createBuilder` on `f5` above would look like this:
1. call `isConvertible(f4)` to check if the child `f4` is convertible - amortized constant complexity
2. call `createBuilder(f4)` to actually convert it - linear complexity in the size of the subtree.

This way, we get an overall complexity that's linear in the size of the filter tree, allowing us to convert tree with 10s of thousands of nodes in milliseconds.

The reason this split (`check` and `build`) is possible is that the checking never actually depends on the actual building of the filter. The `check` part of `createBuilder` depends mainly on:
- `isSearchableType` for leaf nodes, and
- `check`-ing the child filters for composite nodes like NOT, AND and OR.
Situations like the `SearchArgumentBuilder` throwing an exception while building the resulting ORC filter are not handled right now - they just get thrown out of the class, and this change preserves this behaviour.

This PR extracts this part of the code to a separate class which allows the conversion to make very efficient checks to confirm that a given child is convertible before actually converting it.

Results:
Before:
- converting a skewed tree with a height of ~35 took about 6-7 hours.
- converting a skewed tree with hundreds or thousands of nodes would be completely impossible.

Now:
- filtering against a skewed tree with a height of 1500 in the benchmark suite finishes in less than 10 seconds.

## Steps to reproduce
```scala
val schema = StructType.fromDDL(""col INT"")
(20 to 30).foreach { width =>
  val whereFilter = (1 to width).map(i => EqualTo(""col"", i)).reduceLeft(Or)
  val start = System.currentTimeMillis()
  OrcFilters.createFilter(schema, Seq(whereFilter))
  println(s""With $width filters, conversion takes ${System.currentTimeMillis() - start} ms"")
}
```

### Before this PR
```
With 20 filters, conversion takes 363 ms
With 21 filters, conversion takes 496 ms
With 22 filters, conversion takes 939 ms
With 23 filters, conversion takes 1871 ms
With 24 filters, conversion takes 3756 ms
With 25 filters, conversion takes 7452 ms
With 26 filters, conversion takes 14978 ms
With 27 filters, conversion takes 30519 ms
With 28 filters, conversion takes 60361 ms // 1 minute
With 29 filters, conversion takes 126575 ms // 2 minutes 6 seconds
With 30 filters, conversion takes 257369 ms // 4 minutes 17 seconds
```

### After this PR
```
With 20 filters, conversion takes 12 ms
With 21 filters, conversion takes 0 ms
With 22 filters, conversion takes 1 ms
With 23 filters, conversion takes 0 ms
With 24 filters, conversion takes 1 ms
With 25 filters, conversion takes 1 ms
With 26 filters, conversion takes 0 ms
With 27 filters, conversion takes 1 ms
With 28 filters, conversion takes 0 ms
With 29 filters, conversion takes 1 ms
With 30 filters, conversion takes 0 ms
```

## How was this patch tested?

There are no changes in behaviour, and the existing tests pass. Added new benchmarks that expose the problematic behaviour and they finish quickly with the changes applied.

Currently it is not specified, and since allocations are usually
requested once we hit a renderscript breakpoint, the language will be
inferred being as renderscript by the ExpressionParser.
Actually allocations attempt to invoke functions part of the RS runtime,
written in C/C++, so evaluating the calls in RenderScript could be
misleading.

In particular, in MIPS, the ABI between C/C++ (mips o32) and
renderscript (arm) might introduce subtle bugs when evaluating such
expressions.

This change explicitly sets the language used to evaluate the allocations
as C++.

Updated the ""create-update-delete-deployment"" example to use apps/v1 and removed rollback example

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

*Waiting for migration to apps/v1*
> The current example at [create-update-delete-deployment/main.go](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/staging/src/k8s.io/client-go/examples/create-update-delete-deployment/main.go) was using `RollbackTo` of `v1beta1.DeploymentSpec` which is deprecated.

The current implementation upgrades `create-update-delete-deployment` main.go to use **apps/v1** instead of **extensions/v1beta1** and removed rollback example for now. 

**Which issue(s) this PR fixes**
Helps kubernetes/client-go#346

**Special notes for your reviewer**:
Since it's my first PR dealing with codebase and not a typo fix :xD please let me know my mistakes.
I would love to resolve them.

freebsd/phabricator,105cbaaee1dd52fe3ae6c05f531560163f29cd34,"Implement a basic version of ApplicationEditor in Paste

Summary:
Ref T9132. Ref T4768. This is a rough v0 of ApplicationEditor, which replaces the edit workflow in Paste.

This mostly looks and works like ApplicationSearch, and is heavily modeled on it.

Roughly, we define a set of editable fields and the ApplicationEditor stuff builds everything else.

This has no functional changes, except:

  - I removed ""Fork Paste"" since I don't think it's particularly useful now that pastes are editable. We could restore it if users miss it.
  - Subscribers are now editable.
  - Form field order is a little goofy (this will be fixed in a future diff).
  - Subscribers and projects are now race-resistant.

The race-resistance works like this: instead of submitting just the new value (""subscribers=apple, dog"") and doing a set operation (""set subscribers = apple, dog""), we submit the old and new values (""original=apple"" + ""new=apple, dog"") then apply the user's changes as an add + remove (""add=dog"", ""remove=<none>""). This means that two users who do ""Edit Paste"" at around the same time and each add or remove a couple of subscribers won't overwrite each other, unless they actually add or remove the exact same subscribers (in which case their edits legitimately conflict). Previously, the last user to save would win, and whatever was in their field would overwrite the prior state, potentially losing the first user's edits.

Test Plan:
  - Created pastes.
  - Created pastes via API.
  - Edited pastes.
  - Edited every field.
  - Opened a paste in two windows and did project/subscriber edits in each, saved in arbitrary order, had edits respected.

The `Security\Acl` is removed from the core and is loaded from its own repository. All tests were passing and this is fully backwards compatible. I have removed all but the Test files in the first step and added the dependency to verify the Test were still working with the package dependency. The second step was to remove the remaining test files and tests are still running for both the Bundle and the Framework. Once the Read-Only repository is a full standalone repository, this PR can be merged.

- [x] Remove component from the core
- [ ] Remove read-only from https://github.com/symfony/security-acl

Once this PR is merged, I can start working on splitting the SecurityBundle and extracting the ACL part to the AclBundle.

This introduces undesirable `Rails.logger` formatters (such as the syslog
formatter) onto a `Logger.new(STDERR)` for the console. The production
logger may be going elsewhere than standard io, so we can't presume to
reuse its formatter.

With syslog, this causes missing newlines in the console, so irb prompts
start at the end of the last log message.

We can work to expose the console formatter in another way to address
the original issue.

I'm not fully confident in this change, so let someone review it before mergin please. My thinking was - since ""auto_initialized"" option is always passed to a form factory, it should be required by the base type.

This removes the need for us to do the re-ordering by walking the AST in

since the collector needs to be the thing which knows about the index,
while the visitor is the thing that needs to know the syntax. The
BindParam needs to know about neither of these things, so it's been
changed to stop being a subclass of SqlLiteral

Added capability to bypass first level staging if the input files in the replica catalog have a pool attribute matching the site at which a job is being run. This applies in case of worker node execution.

The cache file generated in the submit directory is the transient replica catalog. It also now has locations of where the inpute files are staged on the remote sites. Earlier it was only the files that were generated by the workflow.

The transient replica catalog handle is now stored in PegasusBag as it is required by the SLS module implementations. The Transfer and S3 SLS implementations were modified to pick up the input locations of the input data from the locations in the transient RC.

Prior to this commit, the ObjectIdentity id had to be a number. This
commit allows for domain objects to use UUIDs as their identifier. The
fully qualified class name of the identifier type can be specified
in the acl_object_identity table and a ConversionService can be provided
to BasicLookupStrategy to convert from String to the actual identifier
type.

There are the following other changes:

 - BasicLookupStrategy has a new property, aclClassIdSupported, which
 is used to retrieve the new column from the database. This preserves
 backwards-compatibility, as it is false by default.

 - JdbcMutableAclService has the same property, aclClassIdSupported,
 which is needed to modify the insert statement to write to the
 new column. Defaults to false for backwards-compatibility.

 - Tests have been updated to verify both the existing functionality
 for backwards-compatibility and the new functionality.

If Spark lunched multiple executors in one host for one application, every executor would download it dependent files and jars (if not using local: url) independently. It maybe result in huge latency. In my case, it result in 20 seconds latency to download dependent jars(size about 17M) when I lunched 32 executors in every host(total 4 hosts).

This patch will cache downloaded files and jars for executors to reduce network throughput and download latency. In my case, the latency was reduced from 20 seconds to less than 1 second.

paolodedios/tensorflow,e9ac8da01dccabb44685399f4e676285a9b57425,"Use DialectConversion to lower the Affine dialect to the Standard dialect

This introduces the support for region-containing operations to the dialect
conversion framework in order to support the conversion of affine control-flow
operations into the standard control flow with branches.  Regions that belong
to an operation are converted before the operation itself.  The
DialectConversionPattern can therefore access the converted regions of the
original operation and process them further if necessary.  In particular, the
conversion is allowed to move the blocks from the original region to other
regions and to split blocks into multiple blocks.  All block manipulations must
be performed through the PatternRewriter to ensure they will be undone if the
conversion fails.

Port the pass converting from the affine dialect (loops and ifs with bodies as
regions) to the standard dialect (branch-based cfg) to use DialectConversion in
order to exercise this new functionality.  The modification to the lowering
functions are minor and are focused on using the PatterRewriter instead of
directly modifying the IR.

While #29186 addresses the issue of `docker inspect <unknown object>`

out `object not found` on Windows as well. This is actually misleading
as plugin is not supported on Windows.

This fix reverted the change in #29186 while at the same time,

- `docker inspect <unknown object>` returns `not found` on Windows

Summary:
Fixes T12811. The issue here //appears// to be that both the ""alice committed rXYZabc"" and ""Herald added projects..."" actions have the same (default) strength and end up applying in arbitrary order, and probably got shuffled around as this transitioned to Modular transactions.

Give ""alice committed rXYZabc"" an explicitly higher action strength.

Test Plan:
  - Wrote an ""Always, add project X"" Herald rule for commits.
  - Ran `bin/repository reparse --herald ...`.
  - Saw an ""alice committed rXYZabc"" story instead of a ""Herald added projects: X"" story.

Stack spiller tried to save a temp and reuses spilled LHS to store the results of the whole expression.
However, the LHS is not always spilled into a temp. Readonly fields, for example, stay as they are.

As a result the optimization leads to modification of the readonly field which is not even verifiable.,

The change simply introduces a temp, which, if happens to be temp copy of a temp and thus unnecessary, is elided by the stack optimizer who is in a better position to reason about redundancy of locals.

This PR adds bash scripts in which kubemark is able to be run on IKS clusters. This adds versatility to the testing ability of kubemark by adding another cloud provider and example of use.

Support containerized kubelet in CI

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

  * Adjust hyperkube Makefile to allow HYPERKUBE_BIN to be
    specified from outside

  * new DOCKER_ROOT variable to specify --root-dir and associated
    volume for kubelet to know where docker directory lives

  * Save the docker logs when we kill the kubelet container

  * Allow customized image for dockerized kubelet and build a Default
    image if one is not specified

  We should allow a custom build using script we have:
  `VERSION=""latest"" REGISTRY=""k8s.gcr.io"" hack/dev-push-hyperkube.sh`

  to be used quickly using DOCKERIZE_KUBELET. To do this we remove the
  hard coded `k8s.gcr.io/kubelet` image and introduce a new environment
  variable `KUBELET_IMAGE`.

  Note that we are switching to hyperkube from kubelet as we have a quick
  and easy script to build hyperkube image and load it into local docker
  daemon. This reduces bad hacks like `docker tag
  k8s.gcr.io/hyperkube-amd64:<tag> k8s.gcr.io/kubelet:latest` being used
  by folks today (see 62057)

  * Better cope with PID 0 when running ""docker inspect"" to look for
    the process id for kubelet container

sly7-7/ember.js,e0fc791c95ffe88797f9e6755708f5b613296095,"Fix toString to not add the property on the class

When calling `toString()` method on an Ember Object, it attaches the `toString` as a class property for the first time. This does not seem right since this should be on the prototype of the class. We could memoize the value on the class meta data.

In v2.5.0 and above, when calling `.set()` on an Ember Object, you end up also attaching the `toString()` property on the class. This [PR](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/commit/3a2486eb911ad77d2ab1a4324c1aacef08c156da) calls `toString()` on the object during setting any property. Therefore, when you walk through the object properties you end up getting an additional property on the object.

For a multi-arch toolchain, gconv modules are in a sub-directory named
after the machine gcc targets. This is the case, for example, for the
Linaro ARM 2014.09 toolchain, which has the gconv modules in (relative
to the sysroot):
    /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/gconv

while the Sourcery CodeBench ARM 2014.05 (non-multi-arch) has them in:
    /usr/lib/gconv

So, to catter for both cases, search both paths. We want to favour the
machine-specific gconv modules over potentially existing ""generic"" ones,
so we first search that (if it exists) and fallback to looking in the
generic location.

Common insensitive platforms are `win32/win64` (see:
[here](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/3e4c5c95abd515eb9713b881d27ab3a93cc00461/src/compiler/sys.ts#L681-L682))

Currently when running `bazel build packages/core --define=compile=aot`, the `compiler-cli` will throw because it cannot find the `index.ngfactory.ts` file in the compiler host. This is because the shim host wrapper is not properly generating the requested `ngfactory` file.

This happens because we call `getCanonicalFileName` that returns a path that is different to the actual program filenames that are used to construct a map of generated files. Since the generators always use the paths which are not ""canonical"" and pases them internally like that, we can just stop manually calling `getCanonicalFileName`.

dns_autoscaling test: Don't expect configMap to be re-created with previous params

Fix #42766.

In dns_autoscaling e2e test, there is a test case that we delete the kube-dns-autoscaler configMap first and wait for it to be recreated with previous params. This is not necessarily true, because we will preserve the kube-dns-autoscaler configMap during upgrade but we may update the default params in kube-dns-autoscale binary, which means a configMap with new params will be created in the upgrade case.

### What changes were proposed in this pull request?

Explicitly clear registered metrics when `MetricsSystem` shuts down.

### Why are the changes needed?

See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29795 for a complete explanation. The TL;DR is there is some evidence this could leak resources after Spark is shut down, and that may be a minor issue in Spark 3+ for apps or tests that re-start SparkContexts in the same JVM.

### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?

The possible difference here is that, after Spark is stopped, metrics are no longer available. It's unclear to me whether this is intended behavior anyway.

### How was this patch tested?

See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29795 for more context:
- Spark 3 already passes tests without this change
- Spark 2.4 does too, as exists in branch-2.4 now
- Spark 2.4 fails tests if metrics 4.x is used, without this change

The last point is not directly relevant, as Spark 2.4 will not use metrics 4.x. It's evidence that it addresses some potential issue, however.

Closes #26427 from srowen/SPARK-29795.

even if there is no such file an empty /etc/cloud directory is

This empty directory ends up on /writable/system-data/etc/cloud
and that will block the initial boot from populating that dir
with the data from the core18 /etc/cloud directory when this

airspeedswift/swift,3bdcb00b0fa131dd35d4cc71843b211d4c82df5e,"[IRGenSIL] Force early materialization of liverange-extended values

At -Onone, we may opt to extend the liverange of a value by inserting
fake uses of the value in blocks which postdominate its def. This keeps
values available throughout the entirety of a function when stepping
through it in a debugger.

This patch makes it so that we also insert a fake use at the start of a
value's lifetime. This forces early materialization of the value, i.e it
becomes available for inspection in a debugger as soon as it's defined.

This is useful when a value has no uses except fake uses. In such cases,
ISel may (correctly!) decide to materialize the value at the end of its
scope. This is really unintuitive and unhelpful for users, because you
need to be done stepping through the value's scope before you can
inspect it.

For the same reasons, forcing early materialization is also useful when
a value *does* have uses. Consider:

  let d = ...
  print(""Here is the value of d: \(d)"")

Without early materialization, if you set a breakpoint on the line
containing the print, you would not be able to inspect ""d"". That's
because ""d"" would be materialized right before string interpolation
happens, which is *after* the breakpoint PC.

To avoid races with the periodic tasks, we restore the

Previously, we tried to move the restoration out of already overcrowded
__init__, but doing the restoration in Vm._run opens the gate
for races on startup. To fix them, we would need synchronization
between threads, so moving the restoration in __init__ seems
the (slightly) lesser evil.

SeleniumHQ/buck,19ecb7dec186c2e1dda1040c2041dca37a8e3d9c,"Fix race-condition handling classes.jar

Summary:
We currently use an `OutputOnlyBuildRule` to wrap the `classes.jar`
output of the `UnzipAar` rule, so that consumers can reference the
`classes.jar` via a `BuildTargetSourcePath`.  However, this means that
two build rules will now write to the same path (for `classes.jar`)
when they pull from cache.

This appears to be able to cause corruption in how the `CachingBuildEngine`
works, since as soon as the `UnzipAar` rule finishes, it then kicks off
the `OutputOnlyBuildRule` that wraps the `classes.jar` file while uploading
to the cache in parallel.  If the `OutputOnlyBuildRule` fetches it's cached
`classes.jar` file from cache it can possible overwrite the one we're uploading
to cache causing corruption.

This has been this way for a while.  However, until D1834999 went in,
we never had an actual dep on the `OutputOnlyBuildRule`, which meant
it never actually ran.

This diff replaces the uses of `OutputOnlyBuildRule` with a `BuildTargetSourcePath`
using an explicit path to avoid this issue.

7a8c251901 made this logic hard to follow. After that change, messages would
not be sent to a peer via SendMessages() before the handshake was complete, but
messages could still be sent as a response to an incoming message.

For example, if a peer had not yet sent a verack, we wouldn't notify it about
new blocks, but we would respond to a PING with a PONG.

This change makes the behavior straightforward: until we've received a verack,
never send any message other than version/verack/reject.

The behavior until a VERACK is received has always been undefined, this change
just tightens our policy.

This also makes testing much easier, because we can now connect but not send
version/verack, and anything sent to us is an error.

This patchset updates module integration testing to
validate the changes in PR #5454

This patchset instructs apache2_module to disable all
mpm modules, enable mpm_event, then disable mpm_event
and enable mpm_worker.

This patchset instructs apache2_module to disable all
mpm modules with `ignore_configcheck` set to False
and then disable all mpm modules with `ignore_configcheck`
set to True.

SuSe family of distributions do not ship apache2 with
mpm modules other than prefork. mpm_event and mpm_worker
checks are skipped for SuSe family of distributions.

Follow-up to https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/31848

When a thread exits, make sure that we iterate over QgsCoordinateTransform::sTransforms
to remove from QgsCoordinateTransformPrivate::mProjProjections objects that
relates to the current thread, in order to free memory.

This is only implemented in the PROJ >= 6 case. In theory, we could probably
now revert //github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/31848 for its PROJ 6 code paths, but
keeping it doesn't hurt...

A similar fix could potentially be done in PROJ < 6 case, but it would require

The phy handling code forces a phy mdio address and the switch port to
which a phy is attached to be the same. Albeit such a configuration is
used for most boards, it isn't for all.

ensure the correct list entry is edited and not the list entry that

Use the mdio address with mdiobus_get_phy instead of the port number,

binary library shipped independently of a client app (say, because it's
part of the OS). Restructure the existing discussion of ""fragility
attributes"" to describe how each of those capabilities is affected when,
say, marking a struct as ""fixed-layout"".

Still a work in progress, and if something unexpected catches your eye
I'd like to hear about it. Note also that this does /not/ describe how
Swift behaves today; we still make many assumptions about types that
will not be valid in a ""resilient"" world.

Eviction Node e2e test checks for eviction reason

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
Currently, the eviction test simply ensures that pods are marked `Failed`.  However, this could occur because of an OOM, rather than an eviction.
To ensure that pods are actually being evicted, check for the Reason in the pod status to ensure it is evicted.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

Mesos agents by default will not pull docker images which are cached
locally already. In order to run Spark executors from mutable tags like
`:latest` this commit introduces a Spark setting
`spark.mesos.executor.docker.forcePullImage`. Setting this flag to
true will tell the Mesos agent to force pull the docker image (default is `false` which is consistent with the previous
implementation and Mesos' default
behaviour).

## How was this patch tested?

I ran a sample application including this change on a Mesos cluster and verified the correct behaviour for both, with and without, force pulling the executor image. As expected the image is being force pulled if the flag is set.

1. Raw records in ETCD that were processed by KMS Provider should be prefixed with k8s:enc:kms:v1:grpc-kms-provider-name:
2. Data Encryption Key (DEK) should be generated by envelopeTransformer and passed to KMS gRPC Plugin
3. KMS gRPC Plugin should encrypt the DEK with a Key Encryption Key (KEK) and pass it back to envelopeTransformer
4. The payload (ex. Secret) should be encrypted via AES CBC transform
5. Prefix-EncryptedDEK-EncryptedPayload structure should be deposited to ETCD

Some interesting things are starting to fall out already,
like the fact that I needed to add a gamma_dst stage to
be able to draw into gamma-transfer-fn destinations.

I've also had to pass an SkAlphaType through to the linearize
functions so that they can maintain premul invariants.  I'm not
sure this is actually a good idea... if you can, please double-
check my logic at SkRasterPipeline.cpp:128?

If it's correct logic, I'm going to need to do it all over the place.
But I imagine you don't do this and somehow get away with it.

network.NewScopedAddress and a few simplifications

I don't know about you, but I'm sick of having to write
network.NewAddress(""0.1.2.3"", network.ScopeUnknown) every
time. So I've renamed NewAddress to NewScopedAddress and
added a new NewAddress implementation that internally calls
NewScopedAddress(value, ScopeUnknown). Changed across the
code base, reducing the line lengths and counts considerably
in some cases. Also, a few other drive-by fixes were done,
mostly to simplify tests (e.g. using the pre-existing helpers
in the network package for handling [][]network.HostPort).

No actual changes were made to the logic anywhere: 90% of the
changes are mechanical search/replace, the rest are carefully
replacing more complicated code with simpler but equivalent one,
taking advantage of the network package helpers.

All unit tests still pass.

Currently, the method `pluginwatcher.traversePluginDir` descends into
a directory adding filesystem watchers and creating synthetic `create`
events when it finds sockets files. However, a race condition might
happen when a recently-added watcher observes a `delete` event in a
socket file before `pluginwatcher.traversePlugindir` itself notices
this file.

This patch changes this behavior by registering watchers on
directories, enqueueing and processing `create` events from sockets
found, and only then processing the events from the registered watchers.

Write comments about ""too many search domains"" and ""Total length of all search
domains is too long"" just once. Also put it on a separate line, as
resolv.conf(5) only specifies comments in a line by themselves.

This is ugly to do if write_resolv_conf_search() gets called once for every
search domain. So change it to receive the complete OrderedSet instead and do
the iteration by itself.

Support struct,array,slice types when sorting kubectl output

Fixes https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/24328.

Briefly, `sorting_printer` only take cares of the following type kinds:

*   `reflect.Int, reflect.Int8, reflect.Int16, reflect.Int32, reflect.Int64`
*   `reflect.Uint, reflect.Uint8, reflect.Uint16, reflect.Uint32, reflect.Uint64`
*   `reflect.Float32, reflect.Float64`
*   `reflect.String`
*   `reflect.Ptr`

This commit aims to add `reflect.Struct, reflect.Slice, reflect.Array`.

Some countries do not exist any more, some currencies do not exist. Some countries (and currencies) started to exist recently. Some currency codes are changed (mistype or result of denomination).

Also I tried to keep the moodle formation of the name of the currencies. The first word is not the country name but the 'belonging-to-country', i.e. not 'Sweden Krona' but 'Swedish Krona'. For some countries it was not so easy to find the correct spelling.

And finally there were some mistakes in the list, like 'Schilling' instead of 'Shilling', 'Riyal' instead of 'Rial', etc. I used currencies spelling from ISO.

Adding Data Encryption Key (DEK) Key Encryption Key (KEK) integration…

… tests via KMS Plugin Mock.



**What this PR does / why we need it**:
Adding integration tests between KubeAPI and KMS Plugin.
Concretely, this test verifies the following integration contracts:
1. Raw records in ETCD that were processed by KMS Provider should be prefixed with k8s:enc:kms:v1:grpc-kms-provider-name:
2. Data Encryption Key (DEK) should be generated by envelopeTransformer and passed to KMS gRPC Plugin
3. KMS gRPC Plugin should encrypt the DEK with a Key Encryption Key (KEK) and pass it back to envelopeTransformer
4. The payload (ex. Secret) should be encrypted via AES CBC transform
5. Prefix-EncryptedDEK-EncryptedPayload structure should be deposited to ETCD

marun/kubernetes,201c11f147c85b029665915bee3a62eea19d6d57,"Fixes for HTTP/2 max streams per connection setting

This PR makes two changes.  One is to introduce a parameter
for the HTTP/2 setting that an api-server sends to its clients
telling them how many streams they may have concurrently open in
an HTTP/2 connection.  If left at its default value of zero,
this means to use the default in golang's HTTP/2 code (which
is currently 250).

The other change is to make the recommended options for an aggregated
api-server set this limit to 1000.  The limit of 250 is annoyingly low
for the use case of many controllers watching objects of Kinds served
by an aggregated api-server reached through the main api-server (in
its mode as a proxy for the aggregated api-server, in which it uses a
single HTTP/2 connection for all calls proxied to that aggregated
api-server).

Summary: Implement most of the core features of XHP:
 * Generate the __xhpAttributeDeclaration and __xhpChildrenDeclaration methods that the XHP library will use
 * Convert ->:foo property accesses into calls to getAttribute()
 * Convert xml literals into calls to constructors

The implementation works by desugaring XHP constructs into core language constructs when they are encountered.

There are still major holes that prevent this from actually working with a real xhp library:
 * Literal text inside of xml is just totally ignored
 * We don't emit the __xhpCategoryDeclaration that tells the library what category a class belongs to
 * We say that the type of every property is TYPE_VAR, which means validation will always pass but code that depends on the library doing coercions based on the types will fail horribly

And we are missing some validation stuff:
 * We always claim that any children are valid
 * Properties are never marked as optional

This PR integrates the new Twig 1.18 Profiler (see twigphp/Twig#1597) into Symfony (replace the current TimedTwigEngine) and adds  a new Twig panel.

The timers are now available for all rendered templates (TimedTwigEngine was only able to get information from a few of them -- mainly the first template only).

The Twig panel gives you a lot of information about the execution of the templates, including a call graph.

Blocks can declare has_config() as true without actually using the

null to its $setting node in its settings.php file.

Automatic merge from submit-queue

Pick a specific GCI version by default on GCE.

Prior to this change, a K8s branch (master as well as release) was
pinned to a GCI milestone.  It would pick up the latest GCI release on
that milestone at the time of cluster creation.  The rationale was the
K8s users would automatically get the bug fixes in newer versions of
GCI.  However in practice, it makes the runtime environment
non-deterministic, and lack of continuous e2e tests mean we would run
into breakages sooner or later.

With this change, each K8s release will pick a specific version
of GCI by default (similar to how the Debian-based container-vm gets used).
Users can override the default version through KUBE_GCE_MASTER_IMAGE and
KUBE_GCE_NODE_IMAGE environment variables.

We expect the default GCI version will be updated relatively frequently stay
updated with newer GCI releases.  We can also automate the process to
automatically bump the hard-coded GCI version in future.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?
A Generate with the `outer` flag enabled should always return one or more rows for every input row. The optimizer currently violates this by rewriting `outer` Generates that do not contain columns of the child plan into an unjoined generate, for example:
```sql
select e from a lateral view outer explode(a.b) as e
```
The result of this is that `outer` Generate does not produce output at all when the Generators' input expression is empty. This PR fixes this.

## How was this patch tested?
Added test case to `SQLQuerySuite`.

Avoids [VSO bug 433873](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/433873).

When mapping an `IVsHierarchy` to the related Roslyn project we end up asking each project for its associated `IVsHierarchy` and checking if various properties match up with those on the ""origin"" hierarchy. The properties supported and the interpretation of their values varies from one project system to another. The `HierarchyItemToProjectIdMap` class was implemented when Roslyn only supported C# and VB projects, and was designed with those in mind. Now that TypeScript can also have Roslyn projects we need to filter out everything that isn't C# or VB or we risk asking for properties that aren't supported or possibly misinterpret the values.

A decl’s full GenericSignature is set during validateGenericTypeSignature().

Then during ConstraintSystem::openTypes(), in ReplaceDependentTypes, the GenericArgs list is built from the generic signature (via getGenericParamTypes()) and passed into a new BoundGenericType.

In BoundGenericType::getSubstitutions(), the GenericArgs are assumed to match getGenericParamsOfContext()->getParams().

However, in reality, the GenericArgs include all levels of generic args, whereas getGenericParamsOfContext() are the params of the innermost context only, so the params array is accessed past its end.

This commit changes NominalTypeDecl::getGenericParamTypes() to return the innermost params, in order to match the output of BoundGenericType::getGenericArgs(). For clarity and to hopefully prevent future confusion, we also rename getGenericParamTypes() to getInnermostGenericParamTypes().",,,,,,

Adding IKS functionality to kubemark

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
This PR adds bash scripts in which kubemark is able to be run on IKS clusters. This adds versatility to the testing ability of kubemark by adding another cloud provider and example of use. The scripts to clean up kubemark after use are also included. In addition to this, minor changes were added to other kubemark related files to increase cloud-provider flexibility.

**Which issue(s) this PR fixes** *(optional, in `fixes #<issue number>(, fixes #<issue_number>, ...)` format, will close the issue(s) when PR gets merged)*:
No issues will be fixed, as this is an extension to a feature.

**Special notes for your reviewer**:
I currently have the IKS scripts separate from the default ones, which are mainly based off of GCE. If it is preferable, I could combine them into single scripts which prompt the user to choose which cloud provider to test. If there are any issues with the scripts or code, please let me know. Thank you!

I used the code in `wiiu/` to bootstrap my own WiiU homebrew app; this
PR reflects some changes I needed to make, that might be useful upstream.

1. Clean up filesystem initialization

Filesystem driver initialization was lumped in with filesystem mounting;
and that was a problem in my project, because I needed to be able to remount
the SD card on the fly. So, now it's split up.

I've added a callback object named ""hooks"" that can be used by consuming
applications to handle filesystem mounting and unmounting. If these hooks are
not provided, then the existing default behavior occurs.

2. Expand socket handling

- add `SO_NONBLOCK` flag for non-blocking socket I/O
- add normal errno defines like `EWOULDBLOCK` `EAGAIN`.

3. Remove RetroArch dependencies

- the exception handler protects usage of version_git with
  `#ifdef HAVE_GIT_VERSION` but not the include, so I added that.

  It also technically depends on version.h, but I'm not touching that.
  It's easy enough to implement and I needed the same functionality. I'm
  not sure what the best solution for that dependency is.

- missing_libc_functions.c included features/features_cpu.h which is
  a libretro include. This appears to be a stale include though, because
  everything compiles and works without it.

maropu/spark,30dca924df0efbdc1b638fa7c705fe8743570783,"[SPARK-4714] BlockManager.dropFromMemory() should check whether block has been removed after synchronizing on BlockInfo instance.

After synchronizing on the `info` lock in the `removeBlock`/`dropOldBlocks`/`dropFromMemory` methods in BlockManager, the block that `info` represented may have already removed.

The three methods have the same logic to get the `info` lock:
```
   info = blockInfo.get(id)
   if (info != null) {
     info.synchronized {
       // do something
     }
   }
```

So, there is chance that when a thread enters the `info.synchronized` block, `info` has already been removed from the `blockInfo` map by some other thread who entered `info.synchronized` first.

The `removeBlock` and `dropOldBlocks` methods are idempotent, so it's safe for them to run on blocks that have already been removed.
But in `dropFromMemory` it may be problematic since it may drop block data which already removed into the diskstore, and this calls data store operations that are not designed to handle missing blocks.

This patch fixes this issue by adding a check to `dropFromMemory` to test whether blocks have been removed by a racing thread.

When we resolve inline tables in analyzer, we will evaluate the expressions of inline tables.

03d6d23810 [tests] make pruning test faster (John Newbery)
1c29ac40fb [tests] style fixes in feature_pruning.py (John Newbery)

Pull request description:

  This commit makes the pruning.py much faster.

  Key insights to do this:

  - pruning.py doesn't care what kind of transactions make up the big
  blocks that are pruned in the test. Instead of making blocks with
  several large, expensive to construct and validate transactions,
  instead make the large blocks contain a single coinbase transaction with
  a huge OP_RETURN txout.
  - avoid stop-starting nodes where possible.

So simplest and most portable option is to use %u and cast the argument

for mp_uint_t) which is wider than size_t and prints incorrect results.

vinodkc/spark,340c8b8387bbaebdd23958c9ee7a352461abc1f8,"[MINOR][DOC] Updated PySpark Binarizer docstring to match Scala's.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

PySpark's Binarizer docstring had two issues:
1) The values did not need to be in the range [0, 1].
2) It can be used for binary classification prediction.

This change corrects both of these issues by making it consistent with Scala's docstring for Binarizer.

## How was this patch tested?

Not applicable because I only changed the docstring. But if I need to do any testing, let me know and I'll do it.

Please review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.

#### What changes were proposed in this pull request?
Based on the [Hive SQL syntax](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-ChangeColumnName/Type/Position/Comment), the command to change column name/type/position/comment is `ALTER TABLE CHANGE COLUMN`. However, in our .g4 file, it is `ALTER TABLE CHANGE COLUMNS`. Because it is the last optional keyword, it does not take any effect. Thus, I put the issue as a Trivial level.

In zebra_deregister_rnh_static_nexthops the nh_p
structure was not being properly initialized for
all the cases that we could be storing a nexthop
for.  This was causing code later to retrieve
the table from an nh_p->family which was garbage.

do nothing because they shouldn't be a nexthop

This is a workaround to prevent the whole build from failing because of
the intree kmods are not supported yet by upstream project.

Root cause is that kernel version should not play a part when making
DEPENDS as the generated kconfig was for all targets that may have
different kernel versions.

One less than ideal effect of this change is that for an unsupported
kernel version, people can still select the intree kmod but it won't be
built.  This may contradict expectation if the warning was not noticed
by them

When you copy a reference to a class from PHPStorm it always start the FQCN with a backslash.

When you now try to search the container for this class using `bin/console debug:container ""\My\Class""` it cannot find it.

This PR always removes the starting backslash before searching the container to avoid this issue.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

This is a follow up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20441.

The two lines actually can trigger the hive metastore bug: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-16844

The two configs are not in the default `ObjectStore` properties, so any run hive commands after these two lines will set the `propsChanged` flag in the `ObjectStore.setConf` and then cause thread leaks.

I don't think the two lines are very useful. They can be removed safely.

## How was this patch tested?

Incompatible changes:

  - Remove //tools/defaults:android_jar. Use
    @bazel_tools//tools/android:android_jar instead.
  - The flag --incompatible_show_all_print_messages is removed.
    Messages generated by `print` statements from any package will be
    displayed as
    DEBUG messages.
  - The --incompatible_disallow_uncalled_set_constructor flag is no
    longer available, the `set` constructor` is completely removed
    from Skylark.
    Use `depset` instead.
  - Variables PACKAGE_NAME and REPOSITORY_NAME are deprecated in
    favor of
      functions `package_name()` and `repository_name()`.

    https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/lib/native.html#p
    ackage_name
  - BUILD_TIMESTAMP now contains seconds (and not milliseconds) since
    the epoch.

New features:

  - Strings have a new .elems() method, that provides an iterator on
    the characters of the string.
  - Now you can access three functions in windows_cc_configure.bzl by:
      load(""@bazel_tools/tools/cpp:windows_cc_configure.bzl"",
    ""<function_name>"")

Important changes:

  - CppRules: Unified action_configs for static libraries
  - Remove support for blaze dump --vfs. It is no longer meaningful.
  - Enable dependency checking for aar_import targets.
  - internal_bootstrap_hack has been deprecated and removed.
  - Properly handle tree artifacts on the link command line coming
    from a cc_library dependency.
  - Allow C++ features to make proto_library emit smaller C++ code
  - The 'j2objc' configuration fragment is exposed to Skylark.
  - Remove the default content of the global bazelrc.
  - In int() function, do not auto-detect base if input starts with
    '0'.
  - Users can now pass --experimental_shortened_obj_file_path=true to
    have a shorter object file path, the object file paths (and all
    other related paths) will be constructed as following:
    If there's no two or more source files with the same base name:

    <bazel-bin>/<target_package_path>/_objs/<target_name>/<source_base
    _name>.<extension>
    otherwise:

    <bazel-bin>/<target_package_path>/_objs/<target_name>/N/<source_ba
    se_name>.<extension>
      N = the file?s order among the source files with the same
    basename, starts from 0.
  - Move (c/cxx)opts from legacy_compile_flags to user_compile_flags
  - CppRules: Remove optional_*_flag fields from CROSSTOOL, they are
    not
    used, and could be expressed using features.
  - Introduce --incompatible_disable_objc_provider_resources to turn
    off all resource-related fields of the Objc provider.
  - Removed the statement of ""What does Bazel support?"" as it's
    limiting/misleading. Added supported host OSes to
    ""multi-platform"" paragraph.
  - android_library AAR output now contains proguard.txt
  - Bazel now displays information about remote cache hits and
    execution strategies used in its UI after every build and test,
    and adds a corresponding line ""process stats"" to BuildToolLogs in
    BEP.
  - Print correct build result for builds with --aspects flag.
  - android_binary.manifest_merger is no longer supported.

Recent changes to devmapper broke the implicit requirement that UdevWait be
called after every call to task.setCookie.  Failure to do so results in leaks of
semaphores in the LVM code, eventually leading to semaphore exhaustion.
Previously this was handled by calling UdevWait in a ubiquitous defer function.
While there was initially some concern with deferring the UdevWait function
would cause some amount of race possibiliy, the fact that we never return the
cookie value or any value used to find it, makes that possibility seem unlikely,
so lets go back to that method

not task_state.  This means that, for example, volume attach is
allowed even when other operations such as migration are in

a task state of ""None""

GEODE-5523: Remove DefaultHashMap

The internal class `DefaultHashMap` was designed as an internal
workaround to return a default value whenever the value returned by
`Map.get(K)` was `null`. Starting with Java 8 the `Map` interface
added the method `getOrDefault`, which does something similar in a more
efficient way but it returns the default only if the key doesn't exist.
After inspecting the code, we don't insert `null` values into the
`statsMap`, so it is safe to delete the old `DefaultHashMap` class and
replace its usage by `Map.getOrDefault`.",,,,,,

dashboard/bin/deploy already allows using a custom version.
This CL allows using a custom version with deploy_v2spa, which should eventually
replace deploy.
Currently, the default version is 'v2spa', which makes it dangerously easy for
somebody to accidentally deploy v2spa from master branch, where it is
incomplete. This CL changes the default version to dev/clean-$USER-$GIT.

NOTE DIFFERENT SYNTAX:
VERSION=staging ./dashboard/bin/deploy
./dashboard/bin/deploy_v2spa staging

dashboard/bin/deploy takes an optional argument for a specific yaml file.
Theoretically, you can deploy other yaml files besides app.yaml using the deploy
script. This doesn't seem to work well in practice, but this optional argument's
existence required using an alternative method to specify the custom version: an
environment variable.
deploy_v2spa always deploys v2spa.yaml, so it can take the custom version in the
optional argument.

This is accomplished by recognizing this specific situation and
replacing the 'objc' attribute with a hidden '_objcRuntimeName'
attribute. This /only/ applies to classes that are themselves
non-generic (including any enclosing generic context) but that have
generic ancestry, and thus cannot be exposed directly to Objective-C.

This commit also eliminates '@NSKeyedArchiverClassName'. It was
decided that the distinction between '@NSKeyedArchiverClassName' and
'@objc' was too subtle to be worth explaining to developers, and that
any case where you'd use '@NSKeyedArchiverClassName' was already a
place where the ObjC name wasn't visible at compile time.

This commit does not update diagnostics to reflect this change; we're
going to change them anyway.

mrenvoize/Koha,b0dc5fc0f32a26c24b6e9da91da6ab2ffda0e2c2,"Bug 15498: Let the user choose the CSV profile to export circ history

The way the export options are displayed at the bottom of the checkouts table
was not consistent.
Prior to this patch set, they are display if ExportRemoveFields or
ExportWithCsvProfile is set.
It does not make any sense, the user could want to export the checkouts in
iso2709 format without having to define a csv profile and fill the pref.

Moreover the behavior of this pref did not match its description: it's used as
a default CSV profile when exporting records from the export tools or the
command line.

This patch set adds a new pref ExportCircHistory and remove
ExportWithCsvProfile. The new pref is set if ExportWithCsvProfile or
ExportRemoveFields were set.
A new dropdown list with the CSV profile list will be displayed in the
export area, at the bottom of the checkouts table.

Note that now --csv_profile_id is mandatory for the export command line
(misc/export_records.pl) if the export format is csv.

Test plan:
0/ Do not execute the DB entry
1/ Clear both ExportWithCsvProfile and ExportRemoveFields prefs
2/ Execute the DB entry
3/ ExportCircHistory should not be set and the export options should not
be displayed at the bottom of the checkouts table.
4/ Remove the pref
  DELETE FROM systempreferences WHERE variable='ExportCircHistory';
and reinsert the previous one, with a value:
  INSERT INTO systempreferences (variable, value) VALUES
  ('ExportWithCsvProfile', 'something');
Execute the DB entry again
=> The now pref should be now set
5/ Export some checkouts using the CSV entry
6/ Note that the export tool and commandline script still work using the
csv format. You have to provide a --csv_profile_id option to make it
work.

When data type is struct, InSet now uses TypeUtils.getInterpretedOrdering (similar to EqualTo) to build a TreeSet. In other cases it will use a HashSet as before (which should be faster). Similarly, In.eval uses Ordering.equiv instead of equals.

Continuations returned from mnesia_ext backends were originally wrapped with
the backend module, but that was a remnant of the earliest implementation,
and is not actually needed, since Mnesia already knows what the table
storage type is when it applies the continuation. When mnesia_ext was ported
to OTP 19, the wrapper got changed to use the table type alias instead of
the module, which triggered an error in the mnesia_eleveldb backend. This
patch removes the wrapping completely.

NickrenREN/kubernetes,d68cd8a0c7e6137ca4219078a3d651ecff03c21f,"Expose object tracker for fake clientsets

Not every object kind can be registered via tracker .Add() called as
part of SimpleClientset initialization. This is because .Add() relies
on UnsafeGuessKindToResource to convert object kinds into resource
type names, which is broken for some resources. An example of an
affected kind is NetworkAttachmentDefinitions CRD that uses
network-attachment-definitions as its resource type name. When
UnsafeGuessKindToResource is called for this kind, it returns
networkattachmentdefinitions (without dashes).

As per the comment inside .Add, kinds affected by
UnsafeGuessKindToResource deficiencies should instead register objects
using tracker .Create() method.  Problem is, current SimpleClientset
struct definition doesn't expose the object tracker in any way, which
makes it impossible to properly register these kinds at all.

To address the issue, this change modifies the definition of
SimpleClientset struct to expose the object tracker used via Tracker()
method.

Before this commit, the `unsubscribed` callbacks in Action Cable server
side channels were never called. This is because when a WebSocket
""goodbye"" message was sent from the client, the Action Cable server

memory could possibly skyrocket with this behavior, since part of this
commit is to properly remove closed subscriptions from the global

then all 10,000 disconnect -- before this patch, Action Cable would
still hold onto information (and Ruby objects!) for all of these now

When you copy a reference to a class from PHPStorm it always start the FQCN with a backslash.

When you now try to search the container for this class using `bin/console debug:container ""\My\Class""` it cannot find it.

This PR always removes the starting backslash before searching the container to avoid this issue.

angular/angular,fa6cbb3ffe2e8de635901421a0411cbefd826c99,"fix(ivy): ng-container with ViewContainerRef creates two comments (#30611)

With Ivy, injecting a `ViewContainerRef` for a `<ng-container>` element
results in two comments generated in the DOM. One comment as host
element for the `ElementContainer` and one for the generated `LContainer`
which is needed for the created `ViewContainerRef`.

This is problematic as developers expect the same anchor element for
the `LContainer` and the `ElementContainer` in order to be able to move
the host element of `<ng-container>` without leaving the actual
`LContainer` anchor element at the original location.

This worked differently in View Engine and various applications might
depend on the behavior where the `ViewContainerRef` shares the anchor
comment node with the host comment node of the `<ng-container>`. For
example `CdkTable` from `@angular/cdk` moves around the host element of
a `<ng-container>` and also expects embedded views to be inserted next
to the moved `<ng-container>` host element.

See: https://github.com/angular/components/blob/f8be5329f8d94128ece5dfe3e8e998fe4077d44d/src/cdk/table/table.ts#L999-L1016

This PR replaces #11456. It adds a ""label_format"" option which allows to configure a format for generating labels. Two placeholders are available: `%name%` and `%id%`.

**Feedback wanted**: Should we change the placeholders to `{{ name }}` and `{{ id }}`?

The option is inherited from the parent form if not set explicitly on a field:

```php
$form = $this->createForm('myform', $data, array('label_format' => 'form.label.%id%'));
```

Follow-up PR: Make the default label format and translation domain configurable in config.yml.

**Special notes for your reviewer**:

Example UX:
```console
sudo ./kubeadm token --help
This command will manage Bootstrap Token for you.
  Please note this usage of this command is optional, and mostly for advanced users.

In short, Bootstrap Tokens are used for establishing bidirectional trust between a client and a server.
A Bootstrap Token can be used when a client (for example a node that's about to join the cluster) needs
to trust the server it is talking to. Then a Bootstrap Token with the ""signing"" usage can be used.
Bootstrap Tokens can also function as a way to allow short-lived authentication to the API Server
(the token serves as a way for the API Server to trust the client), for example for doing the TLS Bootstrap.

What is a Bootstrap Token more exactly?
 - It is a Secret in the kube-system namespace of type ""bootstrap.kubernetes.io/token"".
 - A Bootstrap Token must be of the form ""[a-z0-9]{6}.[a-z0-9]{16}""; the former part is the public Token ID,
   and the latter is the Token Secret, which must be kept private at all circumstances.
 - The name of the Secret must be named ""bootstrap-token-(token-id)"".

You can read more about Bootstrap Tokens in this proposal:

  https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/bootstrap-discovery.md

Usage:
  kubeadm token [flags]
  kubeadm token [command]

Available Commands:
  create      Create bootstrap tokens on the server.
  delete      Delete bootstrap tokens on the server.
  generate    Generate and print a bootstrap token, but do not create it on the server.
  list        List bootstrap tokens on the server.

Flags:
      --kubeconfig string   The KubeConfig file to use for talking to the cluster (default ""/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf"")

Use ""kubeadm token [command] --help"" for more information about a command.

Made PDAs dependant on the message server instead of Telecomms. This fixes PDAs not sending any messages due to no listening_freqs.

When paper is splashed with Ethanol, the contents of the paper or book disappear.
Added white coloured pens. Allows you to write hidden messages that can be revealed by highlighting the text.

This patch fixes the QMSI I2C shim driver so we are able to use it in
Quark D2000 based platforms. The only change required to enable this
driver is an #if guard in i2c_qmsi_init() because the macro QM_I2C_1
is not defined in QMSI headers from Quark D2000.

Since this drivers is now properly tested with Quark D2000, this patch
sets the QMSI driver default options in arch/x86/soc/quark_d2000/Kconfig.
It also adds the wiring information required to test the i2c_lsm9ds0
sample app in the Quark D2000 CRB.

skonto/spark,7b8cd175254d42c8e82f0aa8eb4b7f3508d8fde2,"[SPARK-2521] Broadcast RDD object (instead of sending it along with every task).

Currently (as of Spark 1.0.1), Spark sends RDD object (which contains closures) using Akka along with the task itself to the executors. This is inefficient because all tasks in the same stage use the same RDD object, but we have to send RDD object multiple times to the executors. This is especially bad when a closure references some variable that is very large. The current design led to users having to explicitly broadcast large variables.

The patch uses broadcast to send RDD objects and the closures to executors, and use Akka to only send a reference to the broadcast RDD/closure along with the partition specific information for the task. For those of you who know more about the internals, Spark already relies on broadcast to send the Hadoop JobConf every time it uses the Hadoop input, because the JobConf is large.

The user-facing impact of the change include:

1. Users won't need to decide what to broadcast anymore, unless they would want to use a large object multiple times in different operations
2. Task size will get smaller, resulting in faster scheduling and higher task dispatch throughput.

In addition, the change will simplify some internals of Spark, eliminating the need to maintain task caches and the complex logic to broadcast JobConf (which also led to a deadlock recently).

A simple way to test this:
```scala
val a = new Array[Byte](1000*1000); scala.util.Random.nextBytes(a);
sc.parallelize(1 to 1000, 1000).map { x => a; x }.groupBy { x => a; x }.count
```

Prior to this fix if a root component was instantiated it create host

use of LView slots, the host bindings function never ran on the root
component.

The backend previously folded offsets into PC-relative addresses
whereever possible.  That's the right thing to do when the address
can be used directly in a PC-relative memory reference (using things

DPDK/dpdk,88fccb7a05c64cbb10f2c82d61fafc68f2f2150d,"ixgbevf: fix jumbo frame

When latest Linux ixgbe PF is used, and DPDK VF is used in DPDK application,
jumbo frames are not received.
Also - if Linux ixgbe PF has MTU set to 1500 (default),
then normal sized packets can be received by DPDK VF.
However, if Linux PF has MTU > 1500, then DPDK VF receives no packets
(normal or jumbo).
With ixgbe_mbox_api_10 ixgbe simply didn't allow set VF MTU > 1514 for 82599.
With ixgbe_mbox_ajpi_11 it does, though now, if PF uses jumbo frames,
it simply disables RX for all VFs.
So to work with PF ithat using jumbo frames, at startup each VF has to:
1. negotiate with PF mbox_api_11.
2. Send to PF SET_LPE message with desired MTU.
Note, that if PF already uses MTU bigger then asked by the VF,
then PF wouldn't take any action.

[2.1] [HttpKernel] MongoDb storage for Profiler

As a documentbased database like MongoDB is [supposedly fantastic in logging](http://blog.mongodb.org/post/172254834/mongodb-is-fantastic-for-logging) I implemented a storage engine for the profiler that should enable us to use this database as storage for this.

Activate it using this way:

    framework:
        profiler:
            dsn:     mongodb://user:pass@location/database/collection

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2011/07/24 11:23:06 -0700

btw, the MongoDB session storage has already be rejected from the core so this should probably be moved to the DoctrineMongoDBBundle (even if it uses only the PHP extension and not Doctrine). @fabpot thoughts about this ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Wotre at 2011/07/24 11:52:56 -0700

Just my personal opinion, if it is prefered that way I will move this into the DoctrineMongoDBBundle.

While it is reasonable to bundle all Mongo related things together, I do believe that in the case of logging we want to avoid as many depencies as possible. Some exceptions can occur pretty early inside the framework, and it would be a shame if those aren't logged because this layer is written on top of doctrine. I'm not exactly familliar enough with the symfony internals as I only started using it a few days ago, but I can imagine that this can make a difference with some exceptions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2011/07/24 11:59:10 -0700

I don't ask you to use Doctrine in this code. It is fine to use the extension directly if it is enough.

Btw, the profiler is *not* used early. :)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by Wotre at 2011/07/26 10:45:05 -0700

So... Any final remark whether this should be moved to [the DoctrineMongoDBBundle](https://github.com/symfony/DoctrineMongoDBBundle) or not?

If it has to be moved, any comment on where in that bundle this should be put?

Also, if it has to be moved, how can we arrange the configuration using DI? Currently I've put a line in the FrameworkExtension file to use this engine for everything with a $dsn starting with mongodb; I imagine this kind of ugly depency can't really exist between the FrameworkBundle and another one.

Although it seems completely illogical to me, I will move it, but I do need some directions on how to elegantly do this...

Rather than having a wart in main_cpu_entry() that initialises the mambo
console, we can move it into init_chips() which is where we discover that we're
on mambo.

This also means we don't need to check the quirk again, and has the added bonus
that an assert in chip initialisation (which follows immediately) will actually
produce output.

fredericd/Koha,ed1cadcd3df3379760190ef01fac48e907373722,"bug 2297: improve ModBiblio() to avoid duplicate item fields

Prior to this patch, ModBiblio() would append
item tags from the previous version of the bib record
to the incoming bib record before saving the results,
even if the incoming bib record already has embedded
item tags.

For example, if a bib is retrieved using GetMarcBiblio() then
saved using ModBiblio(), the caller was obliged
to delete any item tags first to avoid duplication.

ModBiblio() now deletes item tags supplied in the
incoming MARC record.  This eliminates the possibility
of duplication, and removes any implication that
ModBiblio() can or should be used to modify item
records - ModItem() should be used for that.

At the moment these two ActiveRecord tests pass with `rake test:sqlite3`,
but fail with `ARCONN=sqlite3 bin/test`.

`Rails.root` is defined when running `bin/test`, but not when running
the rake task. When `Rails.root` is defined, `config[:database]` will
look something like `vagrant/rails/activerecord/db/primary.sqlite3`
instead of just `db/primary.sqlite3`.

Relaxing `assert_equal` to `assert_match` will allow these tests to pass
regardless of how they are run.

I do have a question why we need both ways to run tests. I have been
using `bin/test` lately, but I see from #32426 that this is not the preferred
method.

If you create a share on a Windows machine called foo$ then this share is
of the type STYPE_DISKTREE. So it is possible to administrate this kind of
share. Tested on Windows NT and 2003.

In samba we assume that if a share with a $ at the end must be of the type
STYPE_DISKTREE_HIDDEN. This is wrong, so we need a variable in the config
to define if the share should be hidden or not.

db56755ca4a0e53785b5bf322d3b65ffe328b60a Fix ""gmake check"" under OpenBSD 6.3 (probably *BSD): Avoid using GNU grep specific regexp handling (practicalswift)

Pull request description:

  Fixes #13337 (!)

  GNU grep and BSD grep differs in the way they handle regexps when extended regular expressions are not enabled via the `-E` flag:

  ```
  $ grep --version | head -1
  grep (GNU grep) 3.1
  $ echo ""BOOST_FIXTURE_TEST_SUITE(foo)"" | grep ""BOOST_FIXTURE_TEST_SUITE(\|BOOST_AUTO_TEST_SUITE(""
  BOOST_FIXTURE_TEST_SUITE(foo)
  $
  ```

  ```
  $ grep --version | head -1
  grep version 0.9
  $ echo ""BOOST_FIXTURE_TEST_SUITE(foo)"" | grep ""BOOST_FIXTURE_TEST_SUITE(\|BOOST_AUTO_TEST_SUITE(""
  $
  ```

  The portable way to do it is:

  ```
  $ echo ""BOOST_FIXTURE_TEST_SUITE(foo)"" | grep -E ""(BOOST_FIXTURE_TEST_SUITE\\(|BOOST_AUTO_TEST_SUITE\\()""
  BOOST_FIXTURE_TEST_SUITE(foo)
  $
  ```

The following call done in the group#show page is extremely slow (> 20 seconds):

```
BsRequest::FindFor::Group.new(params).all
```

because of the complex query that it generates. Refactor how the query
is generated, writing in the Rail way improving the performance.

We now use the UNION feature of mysql, which allows to avoid the bottleneck
of OR avoiding indices. The UNION joins 2 SELECT calls that are technically
a OR of a join, but simplifies the way the query optimizer can use indices.

The same applies to FindFor::User, but this code is only used when calling
the API with /request?view=collection&user=X.

benchmarks (on production clone of January, just counting the rails time
without javascript):

opensuse-review-team: 834ms -> 552ms
gnome-maintainers: 13885ms -> 1889ms

(gnome-maintainers is still a bit slow as it has a lot of reviews and the
reviews trouble mariadb indexes, but we decided to stop here).

Following https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/26864, this would allow to configure easily the middlewares by using an abstract factory definition to which are provided simple arguments (just scalars, no services references).

For instance, here is how the DoctrineBundle would benefit from such a feature (also solving the wiring of the `DoctrineTransactionMiddleware` reverted in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/26684):

```yaml
framework:
    messenger:
      buses:
        default:
          middleware:
            - logger
            - doctrine_transaction_middleware: ['entity_manager_name']
```

where `doctrine_transaction_middleware` would be an abstract factory definition provided by the doctrine bundle:

```yml
services:

    doctrine.orm.messenger.middleware_factory.transaction:
      class: Symfony\Bridge\Doctrine\Messenger\DoctrineTransactionMiddlewareFactory
      arguments: ['@doctrine']

    doctrine_transaction_middleware:
      class: Symfony\Bridge\Doctrine\Messenger\DoctrineTransactionMiddleware
      factory: ['@doctrine.orm.messenger.middleware_factory.transaction', 'createMiddleware']
      abstract: true
      # the default arguments to use when none provided from config.
      # i.e:
      #   middlewares:
      #     - doctrine_transaction_middleware: ~
      arguments: ['default']
```

and is interpreted as:

```yml
buses:
    default:
        middleware:
            -
                id: logger
                arguments: {  }
            -
                id: doctrine_transaction_middleware
                arguments:
                    - entity_manager_name
        default_middleware: true
```

[Process] Fix empty process argument escaping on Windows

PR #6796 introduced a regression on Windows platform (symfony 2.3.0+), forgetting to escape explicitly requested empty arguments to ```""""``` and return an empty string instead.

This behaviour is imo unintended and renders the component unusable for corner-cases, where you indeed want to specify an empty argument. One good example of this is assetic and compass, which (up to this day) relies on existence of empty parameters on windows.

Some panic and related links on the topic:

Also add comments on how the connectivity enforcement works.

The implemented ideas are:
1. Missing optional words are not considered to be a linkage
disconnection. They are ignored.
2. Missing links to optional words are prohibited only if both words
are not missing in the linkage. This is done via intermediate
additional variables.

Detailed linkage producing for en/ru/lt/tr/de yields exactly the same
linkages as the existing (5.3.14) regular and SAT parser (of course only
sentences with complete linkages has been tested).

However, I have no proof that this fix is correct for all possible cases.
In case missing linkages are detected in the future (currently nothing
is missing) this code may be the first thing to look at.

The code still contains debug printouts when CONNECTIVITY_DEBUG is
defined, since they may be useful for the work of extending the SAT

`HAL_SW_SWITCH_RADIO_ENABLE_S2_PPI_BASE` is a base number for two PPI

xwu/swift,05fc210be62f38be43b102bd70c75141744e4222,"Runtime: Compact the uniquing header for foreign metadata records.

We can reduce the uniquing header from 3–4 pointer-sized words down to 1–2 32-bit words + one pointer:

- The initialization function (when present) and name are always emitted into the same binary image, so we can use relative references to shrink these down to 32-bit fields.
- We don't ever simultaneously need the initialization flags and the initialized uniqued pointer. (Keeping the ""initialization function"" flag bit theoretically lets us turn a ""consume"" load into a ""relaxed"" load, but that makes no practical difference on most contemporary architectures.) 12 flag bits Ought To Be Enough For Anyone and lets us reliably tell a valid pointer from a flag set, so overlap the initialization flags with the eventual invasive cache value.

The invasive cache is left inline, since we've decided we're not going to make the rest of type metadata records ever be true-const, so they'll already be sitting on a dirty page. A dynamic linker that was sufficiently Swift-optimized to precalculate the other load-time-initialized entries in metadata could likely precompute the invasive cache value as well.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

At Spark 2.4.0/2.3.2/2.2.3, [SPARK-24948](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24948) delegated access permission checks to the file system, and maintains a blacklist for all event log files failed once at reading. The blacklisted log files are released back after `CLEAN_INTERVAL_S` seconds.

However, the released files whose sizes don't changes are ignored forever due to `info.fileSize < entry.getLen()` condition (previously [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/3c96937c7b1d7a010b630f4b98fd22dafc37808b#diff-a7befb99e7bd7e3ab5c46c2568aa5b3eR454) and now at [shouldReloadLog](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/history/FsHistoryProvider.scala#L571)) which returns `false` always when the size is the same with the existing value in `KVStore`. This is recovered only via SHS restart.

This PR aims to remove the existing entry from `KVStore` when it goes to the blacklist.

## How was this patch tested?

Pass the Jenkins with the updated test case.

Closes #24966 from dongjoon-hyun/SPARK-28157.

Passing a falsey option value for a validator currently causes that validator to
be enabled, just like ""true"":

    ActiveModel.validates :foo, :presence => false

This is rather counterintuitive, and makes it inconvenient to wrap `validates` in
methods which may conditionally enable different validators.

As an example, one is currently forced to write:

      def has_slug(source_field, options={:unique => true})
        slugger = Proc.new { |r| r[:slug] = self.class.sluggify(r[source_field]) if r[:slug].blank? }

        validates :slug, validations

because the following reasonable-looking alternative fails to work as expected:

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
This PR adds a PV upgrade test to the new upgrade test framework.  Before, this test had to be done manually.  Currently the upgrade test framework only works on the GCE environment, so I plan to add support for other providers later.

* Update Usage to properly handle non-aggregate statistics

- ChartConfigMenu.js: Removed unused UI component
- ChartToolbar.js   : Updated default value to `none` from `auto` since `auto`
  didn't actually mean / do anything.
- Usage.js          :
  - Removed sections of code that were now incorrectly overriding settings (1224,
    2210) due to the backend changes that throw an exception when a timeseries
    only statistic is requested as aggregate.
  - Updated `onSelectNode` to handle non-aggregate statistics more intuitively.

Automatic merge from submit-queue

Use specified ServerName in aggregator TLS validation

Fixes #49354

The aggregator sets a ServerName in the proxier tlsConfig, but the code path handling websocket upgrade requests did not honor it, and instead tried to verify TLS using the dialed host

* Honors ServerName if already set in tls.Config
* Adds unit tests for upgrade functionality via the aggregator
* Fixes mutation of shared tlsConfig.ServerName in spdy roundtripper

```release-note
Websocket requests to aggregated APIs now perform TLS verification using the service DNS name instead of the backend server's IP address, consistent with non-websocket requests.

     - You can no longer infinitely reinforce them, they have a limit. This should prevent them from becoming so reinforced that they become literally invisible.
     - You can now rotate silicated windows without the icon not updating properly.
     - Silicate now doesn't automatically double a window's integrity, instead, it now depends on the volume of silicate. This prevents windows from becoming virtually invincible. 1 unit of silicate is only 1/100ths as effective as 100 units of silicate, etc.

stylo: Bug 1360144 - make stroke-{*} animatable for stylo.

This part includes making stroke-linecap, stroke-linejoin, stroke-miterlimit,
stroke-opacity, and stroke-dasharray animatable.

For properties that already implemented Interpolate trait and clone() for
glue code, we can just make them animatable by replacing the animation_value_type
with proper type name. So, set animation_value_type to 'discrete' for
stroke-linecap and stroke-linejoin. Set animation_value_type to 'ComputedValue'
for stroke-miterlimit and stroke-opacity.

As to stroke-dasharray, we need to implement Interpolate trait and glue codes
for it.

**Which issue this PR fixes**: fixes #49535 

**Special notes for your reviewer**:
The actual type of clientSet.Core() is already the same with clientSet.CoreV1(), so it should be safe replacement.
The places that clientSet.Core() are still in use are identified by IDE ""find usages"", and changes are made with one time global replace. Hopefully there will be none left after this PR merged.
Let me know if this PR is too big to review, I can split it into some smaller ones.

nirs/vdsm,d9dc07f3c422bc5cc4fcc80d98cea36cad1ad5c1,"spec: Allow making vdsm.spec without running configure

Currently, vdsm.spec is generated from vdsm.spec.in using values
produced by configure.  That means vdsm.spec must be generated in the
same environment as the target build environment.  This is not always
desirable, i.e. it should be possible to build a SRPMS in a different
environment or build dependencies should be available before building
the package (chicken or egg problem).  These changes are especially
needed for current automated package building infrastructures.

This patch replaces the current configure variables with default
values.  While this duplicates some of the values already defined in
configure.ac, the benefit of having a ready to use spec file
outweighs the maintenance cost of the duplication.  The default values
can be overridden by passing corresponding --define command line
options to rpmbuild.

We cannot have a completely working autonomous vdsm.spec, because
package version and release are defined dynamically, by running
scripts from the source directory.  A spec file doesn't know the
location of the source directory when generating a SRPM and thus can't
run pkg-version script from it.  There are the following ways to have
a complete spec file:

- Running configure and make.

- Using build-aux/make-dist script (with or without running
  configure beforehand).

- Using vdsm.spec.in directly and defining vdsm_version and
  vdsm_release macros on rpmbuild command line, e.g.:

   rpmbuild -bs -D 'vdsm_version 4.40.0' -D 'vdsm_release 1' vdsm.spec.in

  The source tarball must be generated manually in this case.

At first I though the cube around the sphere was x-inverted (unless the in tention is to simulate refraction...) I've tried changing that but the effect is still weird. I guess those textures work mainly for the sphere and not for the panorama.

I reused the code and did another example using the skymap. More to come ;)

I can see some lines at the edges of the planes though. I guess that's antialiasing kicking in. Should be fixed with a proper cube mesh I guess.

CanvasRenderer has a property called `autoClear` which is true by default. By making it false you have control of when the renderer cleans the screen (by calling renderer.clear()). I wonder if something like that can be added to the WebGLRenderer? That way we can render the cube outside the spheres from a diferent camera (centered in the middle of the screen) than the spheres floating.

Also, added `shading` parameter to `MeshBasicMaterial` (environment mapping was being rendered faceted when using `MeshBasicMaterial` because `shading` was missing (and thus Faceted)).",,,,,,

Convert service account token controller to use a work queue

Converts the service account token controller to use a work queue. This allows parallelization of token generation (useful when there are several simultaneous namespaces or service accounts being created). It also lets us requeue failures to be retried sooned than the next sync period (which can be very long).

  The wallet header defined some globals (they were called ""settings""), that should be class members instead.

  This commit is hopefully only refactoring, apart from a multiwallet bugfix: Calling the rpc `settxfee` for one wallet, would set (and change) the fee rate for all loaded wallets. (See added test case)

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

Current HistoryServer's ACLs is derived from application event-log, which means the newly changed ACLs cannot be applied to the old data, this will become a problem where newly added admin cannot access the old application history UI, only the new application can be affected.

So here propose to add admin ACLs for history server, any configured user/group could have the view access to all the applications, while the view ACLs derived from application run-time still take effect.

## How was this patch tested?

Unit test added.

People often struggle to get their ROID, so I've created a way for the player to copy their ROID to their clipboard.  This requires a stupid hack because GetPlayerIDHash() does not work on the client end.  Because it requires the player to be connected to a server, I've made a new string on the client's end that is updated when a player connects to a dedicated server, this new string can be easily copied into the clipboard via the Settings page in the network area.  If the player hasn't yet connected to a server, the setting page informs the user, that they must first play multiplayer.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

we we know the slice length in advance, I think we had better use make to create the specified length of slice. This will improve some kind of performance. Since if we create a slice with []type{}, we did not know how much space runtime should reserve, since slice implementation should be continuous in memory. While when we make a slice with specified length, runtime would reserve a continuous memory space which will not result in slice movement in case of current space is not enough.

This PR integrates the new Twig 1.18 Profiler (see twigphp/Twig#1597) into Symfony (replace the current TimedTwigEngine) and adds  a new Twig panel.

The timers are now available for all rendered templates (TimedTwigEngine was only able to get information from a few of them -- mainly the first template only).

The Twig panel gives you a lot of information about the execution of the templates, including a call graph.

If multiple data bag items are specified on the command line to be
uploaded to a data bag that doesn't exist the first will be uploaded
but the next will fail with a 409 CONFLICT.  This is because each item
caches the fact that the parent doesn't exist and tries to create it.

This adds the first created parent to the cache such that subsequent

Before, tracers including Brave and Finagle blindly assumed addresses
and strings were IPv4. While that's usually the case, it can lead to
very late problems, such as runtime exceptions.

This adds a utility to encourage safe parsing practice of potentially
null inputs. By re-using code from guava, we can safely parse IP
literals as well, avoiding troublesome IP from name service lookups.

Ex. if your input is an `HttpServletRequest`, the following is safe:
```java
if (!builder.parseIp(input.getHeader(""X-Forwarded-For""))) {
  builder.parseIp(input.getRemoteAddr());
}

If a Bazel server is idle for 10 seconds, it unconditionally triggers a full-scale Java GC via System.gc(). This behavior doesn't have clear benefits and causes Bazel to steal resources from whatever the user does after invoking Bazel. This CL adds a startup option, --idle_server_tasks, to toggle the idle GC behavior.

Also, add some logging for when idle GC is enabled, so it's easier to evaluate its effects. Example of logging:
```
180718 17:43:04.609:I 247 [com.google.devtools.build.lib.server.IdleServerTasks.lambda$idle$0] [Idle GC] used: 157MB -> 15MB, committed: 421MB -> 422MB

The Gradle plugin integration tests find their Gradle build scripts

convention led to two gradle scripts with filenames that were long
enough to causes problems on Windows.

This commit renames two test methods to reduce the length of their
names and, therefore, the names of their corresponding Gradle script

Automatic merge from submit-queue

kubectl binary plugins

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

Introduces the ability to extend `kubectl` by adding third-party plugins that will be exposed through `kubectl`.

Plugins are executable commands written in any language. To be included as a plugin, a binary or script file has to

1. be located under one of the supported plugin path locations:
1.1 `~/.kubectl/plugins` dir
1.2. one or more directory set in the `KUBECTL_PLUGINS_PATH` env var
1.3. the `kubectl/plugins` dir under one or more directory set in the `XDG_DATA_DIRS` env var, which defaults to `/usr/local/share:/usr/share`
2. in any of the plugin path above, have a subfolder with the plugin file(s)
3. in the subfolder, contain at least a `plugin.yaml` file that describes the plugin

Example:

```
$ cat ~/.kube/plugins/myplugin/plugin.yaml
name: ""myplugin""
shortDesc: ""My plugin's short description""
command: ""echo Hello plugins!""

$ kubectl myplugin
Hello plugins!
```

~~In case the plugin declares `tunnel: true`, the plugin engine will pass the `KUBECTL_PLUGIN_API_HOST` env var when calling the plugin binary. Plugins can then access the Kube REST API in ""http://$KUBECTL_PLUGIN_API_HOST/api"" using the same context currently in use by `kubectl`.~~

Test plugins are provided in `pkg/kubectl/plugins/examples`. Just copy (or symlink) the files to `~/.kube/plugins` to test.

**Which issue this PR fixes**:

Related to the discussions in the proposal document: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/30086 and https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/122.

**Release note**:
```release-note
Introduces the ability to extend kubectl by adding third-party plugins. Developer preview, please refer to the documentation for instructions about how to use it.

Problem description: when using ngTemplateOutlet with context as
an object literal in a template and binding to the context's property
the embedded view would get re-created even if context object remains
essentially the same (the same shape, just update to one properties).
This happens since currently change detection will re-create object
references when an object literal is used and one of its properties
gets updated through a binding.

Solution: this commit changes ngTemplateOutlet logic so we take
context object shape into account before deciding if we should
re-create view or just update existing context.

Plural ICU expressions depend on the locale (different languages have different plural forms). Until now the locale was hard coded as `en-US`.
For compatibility reasons, if you use ivy with AOT and bootstrap your app with `bootstrapModule` then the `LOCALE_ID` token will be set automatically for ivy, which is then used to get the correct plural form.
If you use JIT, you need to define the `LOCALE_ID` provider on the module that you bootstrap.
For `TestBed` you can use either `configureTestingModule` or `overrideProvider` to define that provider.
If you don't use the compat mode and start your app with `renderComponent` you need to call `ɵsetLocaleId` manually to define the `LOCALE_ID` before bootstrap. We expect this to change once we start adding the new i18n APIs, so don't rely on this function (there's a reason why it's a private export).

I got bit in a debugging session on an uninstalled libvirtd; the
code tried to call out to the installed $LIBEXECDIR/libvirt_iohelper
instead of my just-built version.  So I set a breakpoint and altered
the binary name to be ""./src/libvirt_iohelper"", and it still failed
because I don't have ""."" on my PATH.

According to POSIX, execvp only searches PATH if the name does
not contain a slash.  Since we are trying to mimic that behavior,
an anchored name should be relative to the current working dir.

This tightens existing behavior, but most callers already pass
an absolute name or a name with no slashes, so it probably won't
be noticeable.

Makes the API endpoint for the `NotCompromisedPasswordValidator` configurable. The endpoint includes the placeholder which will be replaced with the first digits of the password hash for k-anonymity.

The endpoint can either be set via constructor injection of the validator if the component is used standalone, or via the framework configuration of symfony/framework-bundle.

[1] As discussed in #31054, the validator is not in a stable release yet, therefore the BC break is considered acceptable. No deprecation / BC layer is necessary.

remove apps/v1beta2 defaulting codes for obj.Spec.Selector and obj.Labels

This PR removes defaulting codes for `obj.Spec.Selector`. Currently, `obj.Spec.Selector.MatchLabels` is set to `obj.Spec.Template.Labels` if `obj.Spec.Template.Labels != nil && obj.Spec.Selector == nil`. We should not perform this defaulting operation as controllers selectors are immutable.

Adding IKS functionality to kubemark

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
This PR adds bash scripts in which kubemark is able to be run on IKS clusters. This adds versatility to the testing ability of kubemark by adding another cloud provider and example of use. The scripts to clean up kubemark after use are also included. In addition to this, minor changes were added to other kubemark related files to increase cloud-provider flexibility.

**Which issue(s) this PR fixes** *(optional, in `fixes #<issue number>(, fixes #<issue_number>, ...)` format, will close the issue(s) when PR gets merged)*:
No issues will be fixed, as this is an extension to a feature.

**Special notes for your reviewer**:
I currently have the IKS scripts separate from the default ones, which are mainly based off of GCE. If it is preferable, I could combine them into single scripts which prompt the user to choose which cloud provider to test. If there are any issues with the scripts or code, please let me know. Thank you!

This PR makes two changes.  One is to introduce a parameter
for the HTTP/2 setting that an api-server sends to its clients
telling them how many streams they may have concurrently open in
an HTTP/2 connection.  If left at its default value of zero,
this means to use the default in golang's HTTP/2 code (which
is currently 250).

The other change is to make the recommended options for an aggregated
api-server set this limit to 1000.  The limit of 250 is annoyingly low
for the use case of many controllers watching objects of Kinds served
by an aggregated api-server reached through the main api-server (in
its mode as a proxy for the aggregated api-server, in which it uses a
single HTTP/2 connection for all calls proxied to that aggregated
api-server).

The LLDB project requires an LLVM project containing both clang and
swift, while buildbot-script builds swift outside the LLVM tree.  The
obvious choice, if you don't want two copies of the source on your
system, is to symlink swift into llvm's tools directory.  Yes, building
lldb will still build llvm and swift again, but that's a problem for
another day.  To avoid building swift a /third/ time as part of swift's
LLVM build, we need to tell the buildbot-script to ignore that symlink
if it's there.

Motivation:

A previous change allocated a new thread local string builder if it
was getting too large. This is a good change, these string builders
can accidentally get too large and then never shrunk and that is sort
of a memory leak. However, the change allocates an entirely new string
builder which is more allocations than necessary. Instead, we can trim
the string builder if its too large, this only allocates an extra
backing array instead of a whole new object.

Modifications:

If the string builder is above a threshold, we trim the string builder
and then ensure its capacity is reasonable to we do not allocate too
much as we start using the string builder.

Result:

The thread local string builder do not serve as a memory yet we do not
allocate too many new objects.

Summary:
By forgetting to catch `Lwt.Canceled` in `handle_parallelizable_persistent`, a recheck would stop handling parallelizable commands as soon as one parallelizable command was canceled. We were properly catching it for ephemeral commands, so fixing that here.

Also, the catch is only needed for when we run a command in parallel. Commands run in serial shouldn't actually throw `Lwt.Canceled` (they handle it themselves).

When the configured node timeout is very small, the data validity time
(maximum data age for a slave to try a failover) is too little (ten
times the configured node timeout) when the replication link with the
master is mostly idle. In this case we'll receive some data from the
master only every server.repl_ping_slave_period to refresh the last
interaction with the master.

This commit adds to the max data validity time the slave ping period to
avoid this problem of slaves sensing too old data without a good reason.
However this max data validity time is likely a setting that should be
configurable by the Redis Cluster user in a way completely independent
from the node timeout.

In #18664, there was a change in how `DateType` is being returned to users ([line 1968 in dataframe.py](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/18664/files#diff-6fc344560230bf0ef711bb9b5573f1faR1968)). This can cause client code which works in Spark 2.2 to fail.

This pr modifies to use `datetime.date` for date type as Spark 2.2 does.

## How was this patch tested?

This patch fixes the QMSI SPI shim driver so we are able to use it in
Quark D2000 based platforms. The only change required to enable this
driver is an #if guard in spi_qmsi_init() because the macro QM_SPI_MST_1
and the function qm_spi_master_1_isr are not defined in QMSI headers
from Quark D2000.

Since this drivers is now properly working on Quark D2000, this patch
also sets the QMSI driver default options in arch/x86/soc/quark_d2000/

The two functions that compute the crc16 when writing (nvs_append_close)
and when reading (nvs_check_crc) currently assume that the flash is
also mapped in read mode at address 0. This is not true on all SoCs, and
even less on an SPI flash.

Fix this by adding a new nvs_compute_crc() function which compute the
CRC16 of an entry using the flash using nvs_flash_read, in blocks of
write_block_size. This might not be the optimal size, but it keeps the
stack usage small.

Use this function in both nvs_append_close() and nvs_check_crc() instead
of accessing the flash from address 0.

Switching to blank NAND when emulation is running is an extremely bad
idea. It's akin to opening up a Wii and replacing the NAND chip while
you're playing a game on it.

Except we're not even replacing it with a NAND that has the same
contents. The blank NAND has nothing in it except the save file for
the current game, which is likely to result in the emulated software
getting inconsistent results and possibly even crashing depending on
how it caches title information.

An example of games that check the saves for other games is
Mario Kart Wii -- it checks the filesystem for Super Mario Galaxy saves
to decide whether to unlock characters. With this 'switch NAND
while emulation is active' misfeature, this will likely break.
And that's the main problem: it encourages sloppy emulation and no one
really knows how many things it can break.

Just don't let the user do horrible things like that during emulation.
If they want to use a blank NAND, they can do so by starting input
recording before launching a game. It's likely they will want to do
this if they plan to share their DTM anyway.

When sighing prod images it is important to be able to reproduce them
bit for bit. Setting the manifest timestamp filed to a non-zero value

epoch/major/minor field values will be preferred, as it would have a
later timestamp.

BUG=none

TEST=verified that two images built with this manifest are exactly the
     same (they used to differ before this change).

When expanding the set of uniform instructions beyond the seed instructions

PV upgrade test

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
This PR adds a PV upgrade test to the new upgrade test framework.  Before, this test had to be done manually.  Currently the upgrade test framework only works on the GCE environment, so I plan to add support for other providers later.  In order to write the test, I had to modify and refactor some volume test util libraries.  I reran the impacted tests to make sure they still passed.

gabelevi/flow,442cfbf72e2626ca4eb5a9c59969c3370f31b747,"[hack] Remove TypedefPosHeap

Summary:Previously, when a typedef got declared, it was added to both the
ClassPosHeap and the TypedefHeap. Adding it to the ClassPosHeap was
necessary because classes and typedefs both live in the same namespace,
so declaring a class and a typedef of the same name was an error that we
wanted the typechecker to be able to identify. However, instead of
adding a duplicate entry into the TypedefPosHeap to remember that a
given name was a typedef, we can instead store the kind of the
name in the same ClassPosHeap (ClassIdHeap) table.

This makes lazy decl a bit cleaner -- when a hint is missing a
corresponding declaration, instead of having to query both ClassPosHeap
and TypedefPosHeap to figure out if and how it needs to be declared, we
can just substitute one query to ClassIdHeap.

I also unified the no_typedef check with the rest of the hint-checking logic in
naming. Since we no longer require a separate hashtable query it didn't make
sense to separate it. This revealed a number of places where we should have
been checking for non-typedefs but weren't. Tests were added to demonstrate
this.

The submit helper method was essentially reimplementing assertThrows, so
we can just use the library method now. This has the verbose but
harmless consequence of throwing Throwable throughout all the test
methods.

Also fix another instance in SubmitByMergeIfNecessaryIT where the
refactoring tool didn't detect the try/catch pattern and the code can be
simplified.

After this change, there are no more textual references to
ExpectedException in the Java code. (Just one more reference in
tools/BUILD to enable an ErrorProne warning, which is still desirable.)

  - first commit changes log level for an internal log from INFO to DEBUG. (Not really related, but I started finding the INFO level logging annoying when debuging test failures)
  - second commit introduces a `P2PStub` class - a subclass of `NodeConnCB` which has its own block and tx store and responds appropriately to getdata requests. Not all the functionality is used in `invalidtxrequest.py`, but will be used in `invalidblockrequest.py` and `p2p-fullblocktest` when those are changed to use `BitcoinTestFramework`
  - third commit tidies up `invalidtxrequest.py`
  - fourth commit removes usage of `ComparisonTestFramework`

erlang/otp,3ccc4730e54f0f9e86bf96360b7600ab8c9e1d47,"Rewrite stack handling

Problems with the current stack implementation:

* The GUI assumes that the stack frame pushed on the stack
is level 2. If the 'no_tail' option is set for the process,
there may not be an entry for level 2.

* In each stack entry, the line number is the line number of
the caller, not the line number for the function in the 'mfa'
field as might be expected. That complicates generation of
a stacktrace with line number information.

Change the implementation as follows:

* Keep the information for the current function (its MFA and
current line number) in the #ieval{} record. Don't push it
onto the stack. Only push the information when another function
is called. That will ensure that the MFA and the line number
is found in the same stack entry. That also has the advantage
that if the 'no_tail' option is set, the stack not need to
be modified for tail-recursive calls.

* Make sure that there always is an entry for level two.

Adding integration tests between KubeAPI and KMS Plugin.
Concretely, this test verifies the following integration contracts:
1. Raw records in ETCD that were processed by KMS Provider should be prefixed with k8s:enc:kms:v1:grpc-kms-provider-name:
2. Data Encryption Key (DEK) should be generated by envelopeTransformer and passed to KMS gRPC Plugin
3. KMS gRPC Plugin should encrypt the DEK with a Key Encryption Key (KEK) and pass it back to envelopeTransformer
4. The payload (ex. Secret) should be encrypted via AES CBC transform
5. Prefix-EncryptedDEK-EncryptedPayload structure should be deposited to ETCD

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

1. Currently log4j which uses distributed cache only adds to AM's classpath, not executor's, this is introduced in #9118, which breaks the original meaning of that PR, so here add log4j file to the classpath of both AM and executors.
2. Automatically upload metrics.properties to distributed cache, so that it could be used by remote driver and executors implicitly.

## How was this patch tested?

Unit test and integration test is done.

Bastian Bittorf reported that some of the silent freezes on a Linksys WRT54G
were due to overflow of the RX DMA ring buffer, which was created with 64
slots. That finding reminded me that I was seeing similar crashed on a netbook,
which also has a relatively slow processor. After increasing the number of
slots to 128, runs on the netbook that previously failed now worked; however,
I found that 109 slots had been used in one test. For that reason, the number
of slots is being increased to 256.

  - first commit changes log level for an internal log from INFO to DEBUG. (Not really related, but I started finding the INFO level logging annoying when debuging test failures)
  - second commit introduces a `P2PStub` class - a subclass of `NodeConnCB` which has its own block and tx store and responds appropriately to getdata requests. Not all the functionality is used in `invalidtxrequest.py`, but will be used in `invalidblockrequest.py` and `p2p-fullblocktest` when those are changed to use `BitcoinTestFramework`
  - third commit tidies up `invalidtxrequest.py`
  - fourth commit removes usage of `ComparisonTestFramework`

thaJeztah/docker,a01c4dc8f85827f32d88522e5153dddc02f11806,"Align default seccomp profile with selected capabilities

Currently the default seccomp profile is fixed. This changes it
so that it varies depending on the Linux capabilities selected with
the --cap-add and --cap-drop options. Without this, if a user adds
privileges, eg to allow ptrace with --cap-add sys_ptrace then still
cannot actually use ptrace as it is still blocked by seccomp, so
they will probably disable seccomp or use --privileged. With this
change the syscalls that are needed for the capability are also
allowed by the seccomp profile based on the selected capabilities.

While this patch makes it easier to do things with for example
cap_sys_admin enabled, as it will now allow creating new namespaces
and use of mount, it still allows less than --cap-add cap_sys_admin
--security-opt seccomp:unconfined would have previously. It is not
recommended that users run containers with cap_sys_admin as this does
give full access to the host machine.

It also cleans up some architecture specific system calls to be
only selected when needed.

The normal Prepare step for a build is unpack, apply patches.
But for certain packages, patches contain whole files, which
would be nice to have separately and copied over as a last step
in the Prepare phase.

We need it for some other packages + patches, but I think
the 'hostapd' package can be used as a test for this.

As a quick note:
the reason the condition is being evaluated as
`[ ! -d ./src/ ] || $(CP) ./src/* $(HOST_BUILD_DIR)`
and not with
`[ -d ./src/ ] && $(CP) ./src/* $(HOST_BUILD_DIR)`
is that the latter would translate in a build failure if the `src`
folder is not present (the exit code would be 1).
The first one, succeeds for both cases (if `src` present or not).

JCount/brew,429caf69a9bc3f86e510933d45c8d0cad6db7d10,"Remove Array subclassing

Inheriting from Array (and other core types) is problematic:

  - It exposes a very wide interface with many methods that are not
    really relevant to the subclass.
  - It can cause some weird side effects, as many Array operations are
    in C and have hardcoded return values; for example, combining two
    array subclasses returns a new Array instead of the subclass.

Avoid these problems using delegation and the Enumerable module where
applicable.

When mapping an `IVsHierarchy` to the related Roslyn project we end up asking each project for its associated `IVsHierarchy` and checking if various properties match up with those on the ""origin"" hierarchy. The properties supported and the interpretation of their values varies from one project system to another. The `HierarchyItemToProjectIdMap` class was implemented when Roslyn only supported C# and VB projects, and was designed with those in mind. Now that TypeScript can also have Roslyn projects we need to filter out everything that isn't C# or VB or we risk asking for properties that aren't supported or possibly misinterpret the values.

Before 0.138, the spam check happened in Node.on_update, which
checks `if user` before calling `check_spam`.
WikiVersion.check_spam does NOT check `if user`, so the

straight-forward implementation.  This does not require any extra
alias analysis queries beyond what we already do for non-local loads.

Some programs really really like load PRE.  For example, SPASS triggers
this ~1000 times, ~300 times in 255.vortex, and ~1500 times on 403.gcc.

The biggest limitation to the implementation is that it does not split
critical edges.  This is a huge killer on many programs and should be
addressed after the initial patch is enabled by default.

The implementation of this should incidentally speed up rejection of 
non-local loads because it avoids creating the repl densemap in cases 
when it won't be used for fully redundant loads.

This is currently disabled by default.
Before I turn this on, I need to fix a couple of miscompilations in
the testsuite, look at compile time performance numbers, and look at
perf impact.  This is pretty close to ready though.

[WIP][SecurityBundle] Added a way to extend the providers section of the config

Bug fix: no
Feature addition: yes
BC break: <del>no (for now)</del> yes
Tests pass: yes

This adds a way to extend the ``providers`` section of the security config so that other bundles can hook their stuff into it. An example is available in DoctrineBundle which is now responsible to handle the entity provider (<del>needs some cleanup as the service definition is still in SecurityBundle currently</del>). This will allow PropelBundle to provide a ``propel:`` provider for instance.

In order to keep BC with the existing configuration for the in-memory and the chain providers, I had to allow using a prototyped node instead of forcing using an array node with childrens. This introduces some issues:

- impossible to validate easily that a provider uses only one setup as prototyped node always have a default value (the empty array)
- the ``getFixableKey`` method is needed in the interface to support the XML format by pluralizing the name.

Here is my non-BC proposal for the configuration to clean this:

```yaml
security:
    providers:
        first:
            memory: # BC break here by adding a level before the users
                users:
                     joe: { password: foobar, roles: ROLE_USER }
                     john: { password: foobarbaz, roles: ROLE_USER }
        second:
            entity: # this one is BC
                class: Acme\DemoBundle\Entity\User
        third:
            id: my_custom_provider # also BC
        fourth:
            chain: # BC break by adding a level before the providers
                 providers: [first, second, third]
```

What do you think about it ? Do we need to keep the BC in the config of the bundle or no ?

Btw note that the way to register the factories used by the firewall section should be refactored using the new way to provide extension points in the extensions (as done here) instead of relying on the end user to register factories, which would probably mean a BC break anyway.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by lsmith77 at 2011/10/23 09:19:23 -0700

i don't think we should keep BC. the security config is complex as is .. having BC stuff in there will just make it even harder and confusing.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by willdurand at 2011/10/23 09:41:25 -0700

Is the security component tagged with `@api` ?

So basically, we just have to create a factory (`ModelFactory` for instance) and to register it in the `security` extension, right ? Seems quite simple to extend and much better than the hardcoded version…

Why did you call the method to pluralize a key `getFixableKey` ?

Pull request description:

  Sorry for clickbait, this is only a move-only scripted-diff commit and one documentation commit.

  Longer term, someone who knows something about build systems can make this an actual library. Motivation for this is that each module gets compiled for each target that includes it. For example, setup_common is compiled 27 times (for the fuzz suite) and another 3 times for the other tests (bench, unit test, gui)

This change creates a state machine to handle ap uart detection. It
removes all of the ap_uart stuff from ap_state.c and moves it to
ap_uart_state.c. All boards will now use ap_uart to enable/disable ap
uart and tpm_rst_l to detect the ap state.

Separate ap uart detection from ap detection, so we can disable the ap
uart without enabling deep sleep. If the ap is in S3 on ARM devices,
Cr50 wont be in deep sleep, but the AP UART RX signal wont be pulled up.
In this case we need cr50 ap rx to be disabled and deep sleep to be
disabled.

Start making `k8s.io/client-go` authoritative for generic client packages

Right now, client-go has copies of various generic client packages which produces golang type incompatibilities when you want to switch between different kinds of clients.  In many cases, there's no reason to have two sets of packages.  This pull eliminates the copy for `pkg/client/transport` and makes `client-go` the authoritative copy.

I recommend going by commits, the first just synchronizes the client-go code again so that I could test the copy script to make sure it correctly preserves the original package.

rvykydal/anaconda,259cdf50b1fab2ac840522e254de3442490a8b9f,"Prevent incomplete translations from making the TUI unusable (#1235617)

What happens is that we have the following translatable strings:
- ""Please make your choice from above ['q' to quit | 'c' to continue | 'r' to refresh]""
- ""q""
- ""c""
- ""r""
All of these strings can be translated *separately* and in many partial
translations *some of them are translated while some are not*.

The end result is that we might be telling the user to press say ""p""
for ""pokračovat"" but me might actually expect ""c"" for continue,
because the ""c"" string was not translated to ""p"".

This affects both the Anaconda and Initial Setup TUIs and can make the
UI totally unusable.

The fix for this is to remove the keystrokes from the long  strings and replace
them by string formatting operators & do the keystroke transformation separately,
for example:

return _(""  Please make your choice from above ['%(quit)s' to quit | '%(begin)s' to begin installation |\n  '%(refresh)s' to refresh]: "") % {
    # TRANSLATORS: 'q' to quit
    'quit': C_('TUI|Spoke Navigation', 'q'),
    # TRANSLATORS: 'b' to begin installation
    'begin': C_('TUI|Spoke Navigation', 'b'),
    # TRANSLATORS: 'r' to refresh
    'refresh': C_('TUI|Spoke Navigation', 'r')
}

This makes sure that we will always ask the user to type the same
keystroke that is actually displayed. It also assures that the translators will actually know
by using the TRANSLATORS: comments, translations contexts and dictionary substitution.

thanks @stof

Never say that to @fabpot :)

@vicb he has an exception for ``Boolean`` (and explained why) but the reason cannot be applied to ``object``

@stof all ""Object""s should be covered now. Yeah I know he has such a mannerism !

change makes both consistent. With CMake we were already using the system

sd-bus generally exposes bools as ""int"" instead of ""bool"" in the public API.
This is relevant when unmarshaling booleans, as the relevant functions expect
an int* pointer and no bool* pointer. Since sizeof(bool) is not necessarily the
same as sizeof(int) this is problematic and might result in memory corruption.

Let's fix this, and make sure bus_map_all_properties() handles booleans as
ints, as the rest of sd-bus, and make all users of it expect the right thing.

https://github.com/juju/juju/pull/10083

## Description of change

This patch adds mark/sweep logic to the cache resident manager.
- Each resident is provided a removal message upon instantiation.
- `Mark` is invoked when the mode cache worker's multi-watcher throws an error and restarts.
- After the first deltas are processed following such a restart, cache `Sweep` is invoked.
- Any residents still stale send their removal messages to the cache controller's change channel causing them to be evicted from the cache.

Fixes 25890 flake. Let GC convert ListOptions to v1 before passing it to the dynamic client

GC's ListWatcher directly passed the api.ListOptions to the dynamic client, but the parameter codec of dynamic client converts the options to queries based on the tags in the struct, which are not present in api.ListOptions, so the queries are not sent to the server. As a result, the Watch request was sent without a resourceVersion, causing missed events. Flake #25890 is caused by the missed deletion events.

This is intended to fix SPARK-2977.  Before, there was an implicit ordering dependency where we needed to know the ShuffleManager implementation before creating the ShuffleBlockManager.  This patch makes that dependency explicit by adding ShuffleManager to a bunch of constructors.

I think it's a little odd for BlockManager to take a ShuffleManager only to pass it to ShuffleBlockManager without using it itself; there's an opportunity to clean this up later if we sever the circular dependencies between BlockManager and other components and pass those components to BlockManager's constructor.

Currently (as of Spark 1.0.1), Spark sends RDD object (which contains closures) using Akka along with the task itself to the executors. This is inefficient because all tasks in the same stage use the same RDD object, but we have to send RDD object multiple times to the executors. This is especially bad when a closure references some variable that is very large. The current design led to users having to explicitly broadcast large variables.

The patch uses broadcast to send RDD objects and the closures to executors, and use Akka to only send a reference to the broadcast RDD/closure along with the partition specific information for the task. For those of you who know more about the internals, Spark already relies on broadcast to send the Hadoop JobConf every time it uses the Hadoop input, because the JobConf is large.

The user-facing impact of the change include:

1. Users won't need to decide what to broadcast anymore, unless they would want to use a large object multiple times in different operations
2. Task size will get smaller, resulting in faster scheduling and higher task dispatch throughput.

In addition, the change will simplify some internals of Spark, eliminating the need to maintain task caches and the complex logic to broadcast JobConf (which also led to a deadlock recently).

A simple way to test this:
```scala
val a = new Array[Byte](1000*1000); scala.util.Random.nextBytes(a);
sc.parallelize(1 to 1000, 1000).map { x => a; x }.groupBy { x => a; x }.count

Before this patch, if we'd encounter an instance or template symlink

actually the same as we are coming from, as we'd just spin a couple of

Package installation is particularly verbose, not because of actual
invocation of the system package manager, but because there's a pack of
indirection layers to simplify cross distribution portability.

Recently we ran into an issue where a Travis job is killed after
exceeding log size. As the package trace logs are rarely a problem I've
made as small patch that silences shell trace output around that logic.

To maintain minimal trace we now echo the set of packages to install
along with the name of the function that was invoked.

Thanks to Maciej Borzecki for the trick with ""set -o""

When restoring the random glossary entry block, we need to check that

Before this patch, the block configuration was not invalidated.

Additionally, as a result of MDL-20131, the block configuration also
contains the course id of the associated glossary (which by the way does
not seem to be a wise choice, but I may be missing something). So we
need to remap this course id as well to avoid mismatch.

In _cogl_material_pre_change_notify we need to identify if it's a sparse
property being changed and if so initialize the state group if the given
material isn't currently the authority for it.

Previously we were unconditionally calling
_cogl_material_initialize_state which would e.g. NULL the layer
differences list of a material each time a layer change was notified.

It would also call _cogl_material_initialize_state for non-sparse
properties which should always be valid at this point so the function
has been renamed to _cogl_material_initialize_sparse_state to make this
clearer with a corresponding g_return_if_fail check.

Discussion
----------

[HttpFoundation] Saving session data in __destroy() has a side effect on functional tests

Having functional test with several non-insulated requests, TestSessionListener invokes session saving at the end of every request. But instance of Session remains in memory until it's collected by garbage collector which saves the same data again in __destroy() method.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

This patch aims to address flakiness I've observed in MLEventsSuite in these tests:
*  test(""pipeline read/write events"")
*  test(""pipeline model read/write events"")

The issue is in the ""read/write events"" tests, which work as follows:
* write
* wait until we see at least 1 write-related SparkListenerEvent
* read
* wait until we see at least 1 read-related SparkListenerEvent

The problem is that the last step does NOT allow any write-related SparkListenerEvents, but some of those events may be delayed enough that they are seen in this last step. We should ideally add logic before ""read"" to wait until the listener events are cleared/complete. Looking into other SparkListener tests, we need to use `sc.listenerBus.waitUntilEmpty(TIMEOUT)`.

This patch adds the waitUntilEmpty() call.

## How was this patch tested?

It's a test!

Closes #23863 from jkbradley/SPARK-26960.

Automatic merge from submit-queue (batch tested with PRs 39115, 39111)

Node E2E: Do not use sudo when untar node e2e tar ball.

`sudo tar -x` will [extract files with original file ownership](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/264464/sudo-tar-changes-extracted-files-ownership-to-unknown-user), which is not what we want.
This also causes problem to https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/1348.

Because in https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/issues/1348 we move node e2e runner into a docker container. Inside the container, the user is `root` by default, so the tar ball has `root` ownership.

If we untar the tar ball with `sudo`, it will recover the `root` ownership and the following operation may not have enough permission.

No matter what, we should not recover the file ownership inside the tar ball because:
* We don't care it.
* It may even not exist on the host.

In order for a future patch to virDomainListGetStats to reuse
some code for determining disk usage of offline domains, we
need to make it easier to pull out part of the guts of grabbing
blockinfo.  The current implementation grabs a job fairly late
in the game, while getstats will already own a job; reordering
things so that the job is always grabbed up front in both
functions will make it easier to pull out the common code.
This patch results in grabbing a job in cases where one was not
previously needed, but as it is a query job, it should not be
noticeably slower.

This patch touches the same code as the fix for CVE-2014-6458
(commit b799259); in that patch, we avoided hotplug changing
a disk reference during the time of obtaining a monitor lock
by copying all data we needed and no longer referencing disk;
this patch goes the other way and ensures that by holding the
job, the disk cannot be changed so we no longer need to worry
about the disk being invalidated across the monitor lock.

Signed-off-by: Daniel Walton <dwalton@cumulusnetworks.com>
Reviewed-by:   Donald Sharp <sharpd@cumulusnetworks.com>

Ticket: CM-10948

The previous formula for calculating delay was:

    delay = OSPF_LS_REFRESH_TIME - LS_AGE (lsa) - OSPF_LS_REFRESH_JITTER
              + (random () % (2*OSPF_LS_REFRESH_JITTER));

If LS_AGE() is 0 we get:

  delay = 1800 - 0 - 60 + (random() % 2*60)

So delay will be 1740 + 0..120, so we could easily pick a delay that is
greater than OSPF_LS_REFRESH_TIME (1800).  For the normal case where
we hit this else the LS_AGE will be > 0 so that reduces the chances of
delay being greater than 1800.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

At Spark 2.4.0/2.3.2/2.2.3, [SPARK-24948](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24948) delegated access permission checks to the file system, and maintains a blacklist for all event log files failed once at reading. The blacklisted log files are released back after `CLEAN_INTERVAL_S` seconds.

However, the released files whose sizes don't changes are ignored forever due to `info.fileSize < entry.getLen()` condition (previously [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/3c96937c7b1d7a010b630f4b98fd22dafc37808b#diff-a7befb99e7bd7e3ab5c46c2568aa5b3eR454) and now at [shouldReloadLog](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/history/FsHistoryProvider.scala#L571)) which returns `false` always when the size is the same with the existing value in `KVStore`. This is recovered only via SHS restart.

This PR aims to remove the existing entry from `KVStore` when it goes to the blacklist.

## How was this patch tested?

Pass the Jenkins with the updated test case.

Automatic merge from submit-queue

Stabilize map order in kubectl describe

Refs #25251.

Add `SortedResourceNames()` methods to map type aliases in order to achieve stable output order for `kubectl` descriptors.

This affects QoS classes, resource limits, and resource requests.

A few remarks:

1. I couldn't find map usages for described fields other than the ones mentioned above. Then again, I failed to identify those programmatically/systematically. Pointers given, I'd be happy to cover any gaps within this PR or along additional ones.
1. It's somewhat difficult to deterministically test a function that brings reliable ordering to Go maps due to its randomizing nature. None of the possibilities I came up with (rely a ""probabilistic testing"" against repeatedly created maps, add complexity through additional interfaces) seemed very appealing to me, so I went with testing my `sort.Interface` implementation and the changed logic in `kubectl.describeContainers()`.
1. It's apparently not possible to implement a single function that sorts any map's keys generically in Go without producing lots of boilerplate: a `map[<key type>]interface{}` is different from any other map type and thus requires explicit iteration on the caller site to convert back and forth. Unfortunately, this makes it hard to completely avoid code/test duplication.

Please let me know what you think.",,,,,,

We can reduce the uniquing header from 3–4 pointer-sized words down to 1–2 32-bit words + one pointer:

- The initialization function (when present) and name are always emitted into the same binary image, so we can use relative references to shrink these down to 32-bit fields.
- We don't ever simultaneously need the initialization flags and the initialized uniqued pointer. (Keeping the ""initialization function"" flag bit theoretically lets us turn a ""consume"" load into a ""relaxed"" load, but that makes no practical difference on most contemporary architectures.) 12 flag bits Ought To Be Enough For Anyone and lets us reliably tell a valid pointer from a flag set, so overlap the initialization flags with the eventual invasive cache value.

The invasive cache is left inline, since we've decided we're not going to make the rest of type metadata records ever be true-const, so they'll already be sitting on a dirty page. A dynamic linker that was sufficiently Swift-optimized to precalculate the other load-time-initialized entries in metadata could likely precompute the invasive cache value as well.

ldts/zephyr,85bc0a3fe62001e40bd4d0aab145fb45a2a4c59e,"kernel: Cleanup, unify _add_thread_to_ready_q() and _ready_thread()

The scheduler exposed two APIs to do the same thing:
_add_thread_to_ready_q() was a low level primitive that in most cases
was wrapped by _ready_thread(), which also (1) checks that the thread
_is_ready() or exits, (2) flags the thread as ""started"" to handle the
case of a thread running for the first time out of a waitq timeout,
and (3) signals a logger event.

As it turns out, all existing usage was already checking case #1.
Case #2 can be better handled in the timeout resume path instead of on
every call.  And case #3 was probably wrong to have been skipping
anyway (there were paths that could make a thread runnable without
logging).

Now _add_thread_to_ready_q() is an internal scheduler API, as it
probably always should have been.

This also moves some asserts from the inline _ready_thread() wrapper
to the underlying true function for code size reasons, otherwise the
extra use of the inline added by this patch blows past code size
limits on Quark D2000.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

At Spark 2.4.0/2.3.2/2.2.3, [SPARK-24948](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24948) delegated access permission checks to the file system, and maintains a blacklist for all event log files failed once at reading. The blacklisted log files are released back after `CLEAN_INTERVAL_S` seconds.

However, the released files whose sizes don't changes are ignored forever due to `info.fileSize < entry.getLen()` condition (previously [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/3c96937c7b1d7a010b630f4b98fd22dafc37808b#diff-a7befb99e7bd7e3ab5c46c2568aa5b3eR454) and now at [shouldReloadLog](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/history/FsHistoryProvider.scala#L571)) which returns `false` always when the size is the same with the existing value in `KVStore`. This is recovered only via SHS restart.

This PR aims to remove the existing entry from `KVStore` when it goes to the blacklist.

## How was this patch tested?

Pass the Jenkins with the updated test case.

Closes #24966 from dongjoon-hyun/SPARK-28157.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

Mesos agents by default will not pull docker images which are cached
locally already. In order to run Spark executors from mutable tags like
`:latest` this commit introduces a Spark setting
`spark.mesos.executor.docker.forcePullImage`. Setting this flag to
true will tell the Mesos agent to force pull the docker image (default is `false` which is consistent with the previous
implementation and Mesos' default
behaviour).

## How was this patch tested?

I ran a sample application including this change on a Mesos cluster and verified the correct behaviour for both, with and without, force pulling the executor image. As expected the image is being force pulled if the flag is set.

**Special notes for your reviewer**:

Example UX:
```console
sudo ./kubeadm token --help
This command will manage Bootstrap Token for you.
  Please note this usage of this command is optional, and mostly for advanced users.

In short, Bootstrap Tokens are used for establishing bidirectional trust between a client and a server.
A Bootstrap Token can be used when a client (for example a node that's about to join the cluster) needs
to trust the server it is talking to. Then a Bootstrap Token with the ""signing"" usage can be used.
Bootstrap Tokens can also function as a way to allow short-lived authentication to the API Server
(the token serves as a way for the API Server to trust the client), for example for doing the TLS Bootstrap.

What is a Bootstrap Token more exactly?
 - It is a Secret in the kube-system namespace of type ""bootstrap.kubernetes.io/token"".
 - A Bootstrap Token must be of the form ""[a-z0-9]{6}.[a-z0-9]{16}""; the former part is the public Token ID,
   and the latter is the Token Secret, which must be kept private at all circumstances.
 - The name of the Secret must be named ""bootstrap-token-(token-id)"".

You can read more about Bootstrap Tokens in this proposal:

  https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/bootstrap-discovery.md

Usage:
  kubeadm token [flags]
  kubeadm token [command]

Available Commands:
  create      Create bootstrap tokens on the server.
  delete      Delete bootstrap tokens on the server.
  generate    Generate and print a bootstrap token, but do not create it on the server.
  list        List bootstrap tokens on the server.

Flags:
      --kubeconfig string   The KubeConfig file to use for talking to the cluster (default ""/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf"")

This is one part (see #54335) of enabling vendoring projects like federation to generate openapi code for k8s.io/kubernetes.

edit: These changes are necessary for a project to correctly generate ``vendor/k8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/generated/openapi/zz_generated.openapi.go`` for vendored ``k8s.io/kubernetes``.  Without the changes, the vendored output location for ``zz_generated.openapi.go`` would be ``k8s.io/kubernetes`` instead of ``vendor/k8s.io/kubernetes`` and the input files would similarly be from ``k8s.io/kubernetes`` instead of ``k8s.io/myproject``.

In Spark 2.1, we did a lot of refactor for `HiveExternalCatalog` and related code path. These refactor may introduce external behavior changes and break backward compatibility. e.g. http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-18464

To avoid future compatibility problems of `HiveExternalCatalog`, this PR dumps some typical table metadata from tables created by 2.0, and test if they can recognized by current version of Spark.

Mere presence of the socket in the filesystem makes
udev_queue_get_udev_is_active() return that udev is running. Note that,
udev on exit doesn't unlink control socket nor does systemd. Thus socket
stays around even when both daemon and socket are stopped. This causes
problems for cryptsetup because when it detects running udev it launches
synchronous operations that *really* require udev. This in turn may
cause blocking and subsequent timeout in systemd-cryptsetup on reboot
while machine is in a state that udev and its control socket units are
stopped, e.g. emergency mode.

More HTML::Pipeline filters

The big part of this MR is a feature that is intended to test the entire Markdown-parsing process from beginning to end. See `spec/support/markdown_feature.rb` and `spec/features/markdown_spec.rb`.

One big thing this MR fixes is not being able to type a `<` or `>` anywhere. It now gets properly escaped.

This MR also adds three more custom HTML::Pipeline filters:

### AutolinkFilter

Similar to the built-in Autolink filter in that it still uses Rinku for standard http and ftp links, but then does some further processing to allow auto-linking of any URI scheme. See internal issue https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/gitlabhq/issues/2239

### SanitizationFilter

Created a simple custom SanitizationFilter that sub-classes the default one and adds our custom whitelisting.

### TableOfContentsFilter

Adds the anchor links to each header. This removes some processing from our Redcarpet renderer.

colinsc/koha,b0dc5fc0f32a26c24b6e9da91da6ab2ffda0e2c2,"Bug 15498: Let the user choose the CSV profile to export circ history

The way the export options are displayed at the bottom of the checkouts table
was not consistent.
Prior to this patch set, they are display if ExportRemoveFields or
ExportWithCsvProfile is set.
It does not make any sense, the user could want to export the checkouts in
iso2709 format without having to define a csv profile and fill the pref.

Moreover the behavior of this pref did not match its description: it's used as
a default CSV profile when exporting records from the export tools or the
command line.

This patch set adds a new pref ExportCircHistory and remove
ExportWithCsvProfile. The new pref is set if ExportWithCsvProfile or
ExportRemoveFields were set.
A new dropdown list with the CSV profile list will be displayed in the
export area, at the bottom of the checkouts table.

Note that now --csv_profile_id is mandatory for the export command line
(misc/export_records.pl) if the export format is csv.

Test plan:
0/ Do not execute the DB entry
1/ Clear both ExportWithCsvProfile and ExportRemoveFields prefs
2/ Execute the DB entry
3/ ExportCircHistory should not be set and the export options should not
be displayed at the bottom of the checkouts table.
4/ Remove the pref
  DELETE FROM systempreferences WHERE variable='ExportCircHistory';
and reinsert the previous one, with a value:
  INSERT INTO systempreferences (variable, value) VALUES
  ('ExportWithCsvProfile', 'something');
Execute the DB entry again
=> The now pref should be now set
5/ Export some checkouts using the CSV entry
6/ Note that the export tool and commandline script still work using the
csv format. You have to provide a --csv_profile_id option to make it
work.

wongsyrone/lede-1,d03c89838eca297dd6c364d3bccfb6bab440d7fb,"ath79: initial support for Ubiquiti RouterStation and RouterStation Pro

This adds a shared ar7161_ubnt_routerstation.dtsi as well as two other
.dts files that utilize it, ar7161_ubnt_routerstation.dts and
ar7161_ubnt_routerstation-pro.dts.

The modifications to generic-ubnt.mk, config-default, and base-files
necessary for image generation, parsing RedBoot FIS partitions, network
configuration, and sysupgrade are also included.

This reintroduces vital bits from platform_do_upgrade_combined() and its
supporting functions to /lib/upgrade/platform.sh, which were previously
removed from ath79 in 3e9d9f62258f80298710441e0db557e59e152dcf ""ath79:
sysupgrade: drop unused platform checks"". The new function is called
""routerstation_do_upgrade"" and will *only* work for the RouterStation
series of boards. It does however retain the ability to downgrade (e.g.
from master -> 17.01.x using sysupgrade -F).

All hardware is functional including the AR8216 switch (for the Pro),
wireless via ath5k/ath9k using the miniPCI slots, flash, USB, button,
and LED.

Switch and LAN/WAN configuration is the same as it is with the
equivalent ar71xx targets. MAC addresses are assigned based upon the
content stored in the RedBoot config partition.

Flashing via both sysupgrade and TFTP has been confirmed to work. Also,
the initramfs images are now raw .bin files instead of being wrapped in
a uImage (as they currently are in ar71xx), which makes them bootable
with RedBoot.

One notable difference to ar71xx is the inclusion of the RedBoot
""fconfig"" utility (analogous to U-Boot’s fw_printenv/fw_setenv) in
DEVICE_PACKAGES. The FIS partitions are probed using the RedBoot MTD
parser’s DT binding, whose proper usage is mutually exclusive to
defining a separate fixed-partitions node for ""RedBoot config"". This
config partition contains the board's base MAC address. The lack of a
hard-coded flash location means that the mtd-mac-address property cannot
be used in the .dts, so instead fconfig is used to read the MAC
addresses from flash in userspace during first boot.

This change makes it so that, prior to editing an emote, we strip the
server-side formatting. We do this because that formatting is *metadata*
that we use to determine that a post is an emote (along with other
metadata). However, it is also *formatting* that is undesirable for
Matterhorn users because editing it can break the message's emote
status. We remove the formatting when editing begins, and reinstate it
just prior to invoking the API endpoint to submit changes to the post.
This way, the server's view of the message is the same, and when we get
notified of the edit later, we still conclude that it's an emote and
render it correctly. In the mean time, the user doesn't have to
awkwardly edit the formatted version of the message.

This change also makes it so that when we preview such edits, they
*look* like emotes because we tell the preview formatter to use the type
of the edited message to influence how the preview is drawn.

dreampet/gitlab,ff8cd116a04d187f63222b3b29ebb6818dfd65e5,"Disable --follow in `git log` to avoid loading duplicate commit data in infinite scroll

`git` doesn't work properly when `--follow` and `--skip` are specified together. We could even be **omitting commits in the Web log** as a result.

Here are the gory details. Let's say you ran:

```
git log -n=5 --skip=2 README
```

This is the working case since it omits `--follow`. This is what happens:

1. `git` starts at `HEAD` and traverses down the tree until it finds the top-most commit relevant to README.
2. Once this is found, this commit is returned via `get_revision_1()`.
3. If the `skip_count` is positive, decrement and repeat step 2. Otherwise go onto step 4.
4. `show_log()` gets called with that commit.
5. Repeat step 1 until we have all five entries.

That's exactly what we want. What happens when you use `--follow`? You have to understand how step 1 is performed:

* When you specify a pathspec on the command-line (e.g. README), a flag `prune` [gets set here](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/revision.c#L2351).
* If the `prune` flag is active, `get_commit_action()` determines whether the commit should be [scanned for matching paths](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/revision.c#L2989).
* In the case of `--follow`, however, `prune` is [disabled here](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/revision.c#L2350).
* As a result, a commit is never scanned for matching paths and therefore never pruned. `HEAD` will always get returned as the first commit, even if it's not relevant to the README.
* Making matters worse, the `--skip` in the example above would actually skip every other after `HEAD` N times. If README were changed in these skipped commits, we would actually miss information!

Since git uses a matching algorithm to determine whether a file was renamed, I
believe `git` needs to generate a diff of each commit to do this and traverse
each commit one-by-one to do this. I think that's the rationale for disabling
the `prune` functionality since you can't just do a simple string comparison.

RESTMapping takes a desired GroupKind, and a set of versions, and
returns a rest mapper for the first matching version.  It also has a
list of built-in discovered prioritized versions, to which it appends
the user versions.

However, when it goes to parse the versions, it parses them as
GroupVersions.  Since only a version was passed, the group will be the
empty group (""""), which will only match rest mappings for the empty
group, ergo, none of the user's versions will match if they are
attempting a match for a non-emtpy-group GroupKind.

This fixes that by taking the parsed GroupVersion, and overriding the

This patch splits the balance to match this object schema:

        lines => [ credit_line_1, ..., credit_line_n ]

This change is made to ease usage from the UI. Also because the
outstanding credits need to be applied to outstanding debits in order to
the balance value to make sense. So we still need to have each total.

Tests are added for this change, and the schema files are adjusted as
well.

It has always been problematic, and I've been moving things in and out
of it.

And it just isn't a very powerful widget.  You can't *do* anything with
it.  The information it shows you may be useful, but the core stuff
already shows up in the dive list.

And the dive list is actually a much superior widget over that static
dive info frame.  The information that shows up in the dive list can be
sorted by column, for example.

So when we show temperatures or SAC numbers in the dive info frame,
that's actually a very bad place to show them: we would be much better
off showing it in the dive list, and then we could sort by SAC or by
temperature.

In other words: just remove the thing.  Instead, plan to extend the dive
list to contain all the information.  That will probably mean that we
need to change the current pane widget to be a vertical pane, rather
than a horizontal one, but what's wrong with that?

This commit also eliminates '@NSKeyedArchiverClassName'. It was
decided that the distinction between '@NSKeyedArchiverClassName' and
'@objc' was too subtle to be worth explaining to developers, and that
any case where you'd use '@NSKeyedArchiverClassName' was already a

In structural lookup mode, let's resolve protocol typealiases to
dependent member types also. This is because areSameType() has
no way to see if a type alias is going to be equal to another
associated type with the same name, and so it would return false,
which produced ambiguity errors when there should not be any.

This exposes a deficiency in how we diagnose same-type constraints
where both sides are concrete. Instead of performing the check on
the requirement types, which might be dependent member types that
later on resolve to concrete types, do the check on the actual
equivalence classes further down in the GSB instead.

However, this in turn produces bogus diagnostics in some recursive
cases where we add same-type constraints twice for some reason,
resulting in a warning the second time around. Refine the check by
adding a new predicate to FloatingRequirementSource for requirements
that are explicitly written in source... which is not what
isExplicit() currently means.

Summary:
Ref T7803. Ordering and paging are inherently intertwined, but they often aren't driven by the same data right now.

Start driving them through the same data:

  - `getOrderableColumns()` defines orderable and pageable columns.
  - `getPagingValueMap()` reads values from a cursor.

This is generally sufficient to implement both paging and ordering.

Also, add some more sanity checks to try to curtail the number of ambiguous/invalid orderings applications produce, since these cause subtle/messy bugs.

I removed the last qanda checks in forum_user_can_see_discussion because they are not necessary and

A user in a qanda forum can always see a discussion (he needs to see the discussion to be able to reply).
What he cannot see are the other user posts unless he has replied to the discussion once and the edition period
(usually 30 minutes) has ended.

Note also that forum_user_can_see_discussion was originally only used when displaying forums in blog format

Start making `k8s.io/client-go` authoritative for generic client packages

Right now, client-go has copies of various generic client packages which produces golang type incompatibilities when you want to switch between different kinds of clients.  In many cases, there's no reason to have two sets of packages.  This pull eliminates the copy for `pkg/client/transport` and makes `client-go` the authoritative copy.

I recommend going by commits, the first just synchronizes the client-go code again so that I could test the copy script to make sure it correctly preserves the original package.

### Problem

It was proposed in https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pull/8729#discussion_r351581286 that `BlackSetup` and `IsortSetup` were not doing the right thing by including information about the target in the dataclasses. Instead, those should only have the setup that is used for every target, such as the config file location.

### Solution

Following the above recommendation leads to substantial de-duplication, particularly in the implementation of `fmt` and `lint`. New `BlackArgs` and `IsortArgs` dataclasses are created to capture the main difference between `fmt` and `lint` of whether they should pass `--check` in their CLI args. This allows creating new rules to return the `ExecuteProcessResult`.

### Result

Fewer lines of code and improved readability. Better caching because now `BlackSetup` and `IsortSetup` can be used across many targets.",,,,,,

When rewriting stable-status.txt, which happens on each build, avoid updating
the file's ctime and mtime if the new contents match what is already in the
file.

This prevents tickling the TimestampGranularityMonitor for what should be a
no-op update, which in turn could cause null/incremental builds to stall for
up to a second.  The problem was magnified on macOS where the default HFS+
file system only has second-level granularity.  (This also affects Linux, but
because current Linux file systems have milli/nanosecond-level granularity,
the wait imposed by TimestampGranularityMonitor is minimal and thus not
generally noticeable.)

3f5ad622e5fe0781a70bee9e3322b23c2352e956 Enable PID file creation on Windows - Add available WIN PID function - Consider WIN32 in each relevant case - Add new preprocessor definitions to suppress warning - Update error message for generic OS (riordant)

Pull request description:

  # Introduction

  As discussed with @laanwj on IRC:

  - PID file creation was never enabled for Windows, as the `pid_t` filetype is not available for it. However, the WIN32 API contains the header [`Processthreadsapi.h`](https://github.com/CodeShark/x86_64-w64-mingw32/blob/master/include/processthreadsapi.h) which in turn contains the function [`GetCurrentProcessId()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/desktop/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-getcurrentprocessid). ~~This function is called at a higher level by [`_getpid()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/getpid?view=vs-2017)~~ EDIT: `_getpid()` is not available to the MSVC compiler used in the AppVeyor build. As a result, I have changed the function call to`GetCurrentProcessId()`, which performs the same function and is available to both MinGW & MSVC.
  This allows one to capture the PID in Windows, without any additional includes - the above function is already available.

  - Within this PR, I have added a separate line that calls `GetCurrentProcessId()` in the case of a WIN compilation, and the usual `getpid()` otherwise. All code blocks processing PID file logic that avoid WIN32 have been changed to consider it. I have also updated the preprocessor definitions in `libbitcoin_server.vcxproj.in` to suppress a warning related to `std::strerror` for the MSVC build, that was causing the AppVeyor build to fail (see @fanquake comment below).

  # Rationale
  - Consistency between OS's running Bitcoin
      - Applications which build off of `bitcoind`, such as novel front-end clients, often need access to the PID in order to control the daemon. Instead of designing some alternate way of doing this for one system, it should be consistent between all of them.

kubectl binary plugins

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

Introduces the ability to extend `kubectl` by adding third-party plugins that will be exposed through `kubectl`.

Plugins are executable commands written in any language. To be included as a plugin, a binary or script file has to

1. be located under one of the supported plugin path locations:
1.1 `~/.kubectl/plugins` dir
1.2. one or more directory set in the `KUBECTL_PLUGINS_PATH` env var
1.3. the `kubectl/plugins` dir under one or more directory set in the `XDG_DATA_DIRS` env var, which defaults to `/usr/local/share:/usr/share`
2. in any of the plugin path above, have a subfolder with the plugin file(s)
3. in the subfolder, contain at least a `plugin.yaml` file that describes the plugin

Example:

```
$ cat ~/.kube/plugins/myplugin/plugin.yaml
name: ""myplugin""
shortDesc: ""My plugin's short description""
command: ""echo Hello plugins!""

$ kubectl myplugin
Hello plugins!
```

~~In case the plugin declares `tunnel: true`, the plugin engine will pass the `KUBECTL_PLUGIN_API_HOST` env var when calling the plugin binary. Plugins can then access the Kube REST API in ""http://$KUBECTL_PLUGIN_API_HOST/api"" using the same context currently in use by `kubectl`.~~

Test plugins are provided in `pkg/kubectl/plugins/examples`. Just copy (or symlink) the files to `~/.kube/plugins` to test.

**Which issue this PR fixes**:

Related to the discussions in the proposal document: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/30086 and https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/122.

**Release note**:
```release-note
Introduces the ability to extend kubectl by adding third-party plugins. Developer preview, please refer to the documentation for instructions about how to use it.

RESTMapping takes a desired GroupKind, and a set of versions, and
returns a rest mapper for the first matching version.  It also has a
list of built-in discovered prioritized versions, to which it appends
the user versions.

However, when it goes to parse the versions, it parses them as
GroupVersions.  Since only a version was passed, the group will be the
empty group (""""), which will only match rest mappings for the empty
group, ergo, none of the user's versions will match if they are
attempting a match for a non-emtpy-group GroupKind.

This fixes that by taking the parsed GroupVersion, and overriding the

In all other drivers we are doing so. Moreover, we don't want to parse
runtime information in attach (even if the attach is meant as live)
because we are generating the runtime info ourselves. We can't trust
users they supply sane values anyway.

When doing live attach, we are passing the inactive definition anyway
since we are passing the result of virDomainDeviceDefCopy() which does
inactive copy by default.

Moreover, we are doing the same mistake in qemuhotplugtest.

Just a side note - it makes perfect sense to parse the runtime info
like alias in qemuDomainDetachDevice and qemuDomainUpdateDeviceFlags()
as in some cases the only difference to distinguish two devices can be
just their alias.

The structured selection/loop's entry block does not have arguments.
If the function's header block is also part of the structured control
flow, we cannot just simply erase it because it may contain arguments
matching the function signature and used by the cloned blocks. Instead,
turn it into a block only containing a spv.Branch op.

Also, we can directly emit instructions for the spv.selection header
block to the block containing the spv.selection op. This eliminates
unnecessary branches in the SPIR-V blob.

Added a test for nested spv.loop.

When updating an old .config file that has a symbol that has been

Instead of generating a warning, just print a message that it's being

updated config file to be saved.

If we have a rotate axis whose length is extremely large, we will get an
infinite value, and its normalized vector is a zero vector, instead of an
unit vector, i.e. (x/inf, y/inf, z/inf) == (0, 0, 0).

The solution is: we scale the vector, so the length becomes a finite value, and
we could get a valid unit vector.

Therefore, we use a different normalization method, robust_normalize().

Disabling ethernet during reboot (only to enable it again when the

Summary: Problem
The HTTP spec supports a 308 Permanent Redirect which is similar to 301
Moved Permanently, except that it does not allow changing the request
method from POST to GET. However, Finagle doesn't contain the status
code constants yet. At the moment, developers who use APIs which take in

Solution
Add 308 Permanent Redirect status code constants.

[VarDumper] Allow VarDumperTestTrait expectation to be non-scalar

| Q             | A
| ------------- | ---
| Branch?       | master
| Bug fix?      | no
| New feature?  | yes
| BC breaks?    | no

| Tests pass?   | yes
| License       | MIT

At the moment, when using the `VarDumperTestTrait` in unit test, expecting data object is as follow:

```php
class Toto
{
    private $foo;

    public function __construct($foo)
    {
        $this->foo = $foo;
    }
}

class MyTest extends \PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase
{
     use Symfony\Component\VarDumper\Test\VarDumperTestTrait;

    public function dummyTest()
    {
        $expected = <<<EOEXPECTED
Profiler\Tests\Model\CallGraph\Toto {
  -foo: ""baz""
}
EOEXPECTED;

        $this->assertDumpEquals($expected, new Toto('baz'));
    }
}
```

The same test could be easily written like this with this change:

```php
    public function dummyTest()
    {
        $this->assertDumpEquals(new Toto('baz'), new Toto('baz'));
    }
```

Summary:
See PHI958. Ref T13210. Previously, see PHI720.

The use case for the magic in PHI720 involves multiple patterns, and no parameter can be passed to `branch` that will result in multiple patterns being passed to `git`.

Replace the implicit magic with an explicit `patterns` parameter.

This whole thing is a bit shaky but probably isn't hurting anything.

Test Plan:
  - Ran query with no `patterns`.
  - Ran query with invalid `patterns`, got readable error.
  - Ran query with various valid `patterns` (plain branch name, globs with ""?"" and ""*""), got sensible results.

colinsc/koha,af2cd5e303d5a4446159110a7da27cc5befd5a64,"Bug 23843: Add mapping to Koha::Club::Holds

This patch adds a to_api_mapping method to the class. This in effect
enables calling ->to_api on the object. The mapping is borrowed from the
API controller. It is not removed from the controller so we are able to
verify (through the tests) that there is no behavior change.
Once this is pushed we need to implement the counter-wise methods and
clean the controllers.
To test:
1. Run:
   $ kshell
  k$ prove t/db_dependent/api/v1/clubs_holds.t
=> SUCCESS: Tests pass
2. Apply this patch
3. Repeat (1)
=> SUCCESS: Tests still pass!

Assert fail #18439

<!-- Please describe your changes on the following line: -->

This PR addresses #18439 by removing an assert statement that forces a panic whenever `LoadBlocker` is dropped during a GC sweep and receives a `None` `SCRIPT_THREAD_ROOT` value from `mark_document_with_no_blocked_loads()`. Instead of panicking on the assert, we remove it and let the None value pass silently.

facebook/folly,df9c39d7fd95b7bcb8a6c59aef3620ba486f5e84,"IndexedMemPool: Initialize and destroy Atom in slots_

Summary:
This is only a bug when Atom != std::atomic (for example when Atom = DeterministicAtomic) since the mmap region is zero-intialized, and the std::atomic constructor does no initialization other than zero initialization. However, this assumption does not hold when Atom != std::atomic.

I'm not super familiar with the details of IndexedMemPool, so perhaps there is a more clever way to initialize and destroy the Atom instances in slots_, but I decided to go with this simple solution since it only modifies the construtor and destructor.

stgraber/lxd,2d4cc59e4ba13d91abdf663d2f52459733cf323f,"db: actually enable foreign keys per connection

According to: https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_foreign_keys (and
the comments in the code deleted by this patch); the foreign keys pragma
needs to be set per connection to a sqlite database. The problem here is
that the golang sql driver hides the fact that there might be more than one
connection, and they're pooled, so only the first connection would have
foreign keys enabled. This means that e.g. the constraints aren't enforced
on other connections that were automatically created by the sql driver.

This patch installs our own sql driver and uses that, which uses the
sqlite3 hook interface to always enable foreign keys on every connection
that's created, so we don't have this problem any more.

Following https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/26864, this would allow to configure easily the middlewares by using an abstract factory definition to which are provided simple arguments (just scalars, no services references).

For instance, here is how the DoctrineBundle would benefit from such a feature (also solving the wiring of the `DoctrineTransactionMiddleware` reverted in https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/26684):

```yaml
framework:
    messenger:
      buses:
        default:
          middleware:
            - logger
            - doctrine_transaction_middleware: ['entity_manager_name']
```

where `doctrine_transaction_middleware` would be an abstract factory definition provided by the doctrine bundle:

```yml
services:

    doctrine.orm.messenger.middleware_factory.transaction:
      class: Symfony\Bridge\Doctrine\Messenger\DoctrineTransactionMiddlewareFactory
      arguments: ['@doctrine']

    doctrine_transaction_middleware:
      class: Symfony\Bridge\Doctrine\Messenger\DoctrineTransactionMiddleware
      factory: ['@doctrine.orm.messenger.middleware_factory.transaction', 'createMiddleware']
      abstract: true
      # the default arguments to use when none provided from config.
      # i.e:
      #   middlewares:
      #     - doctrine_transaction_middleware: ~
      arguments: ['default']
```

and is interpreted as:

```yml
buses:
    default:
        middleware:
            -
                id: logger
                arguments: {  }
            -
                id: doctrine_transaction_middleware
                arguments:
                    - entity_manager_name
        default_middleware: true
```

Split out the hostname when default dhcp_domain is used in nova.conf

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

When /etc/nova/nova.conf does not have specify dhcp_domain to empty
string, a default string of '.novalocal' is returned by the meta data
service. So we need to just split the string and pick the first one
in the array.

```
$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/hostname
testvm-1.novalocal
$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-hostname

This patch makes it possible to reboot an instance that is in rescue mode.

It causes the reboot action to search first for rescue mode VM (the
normal VMs name plus '-rescue') .. if it can't find it, it does a reboot
of the normal VM. If it finds the rescue one first, it'll reboot the
rescue instance.

If there is more than one VM named 'myvm-rescue', it'll raise an
exception just like it did if there were more than one VM named 'myvm'.

llvm-mirror/llvm,d17ccfb9807e7b3c870c7936581d17aa1eb5cbbe,"[XRay] Detect and emit sleds for sibling/tail calls

Summary:
This change promotes the 'isTailCall(...)' member function to
TargetInstrInfo as a query interface for determining on a per-target
basis whether a given MachineInstr is a tail call instruction. We build
upon this in the XRay instrumentation pass to emit special sleds for
tail call optimisations, where we emit the correct kind of sled.

The tail call sleds look like a mix between the function entry and
function exit sleds. Form-wise, the sled comes before the ""jmp""
instruction that implements the tail call similar to how we do it for
the function entry sled. Functionally, because we know this is a tail
call, it behaves much like an exit sled -- i.e. at runtime we may use
the exit trampolines instead of a different kind of trampoline.

A follow-up change to recognise these sleds will be done in compiler-rt,
so that we can start intercepting these initially as exits, but also
have the option to have different log entries to more accurately reflect
that this is actually a tail call.

Note that while it appears that n must be bound to the interval [0,3]
due to the way it is extracted from addr, we cannot guarantee that
compiler transformations (and/or future refactoring) will ensure this is
the case, and given this is a slow path it's better to always perform

Taeung/tip,acecdb3cf42576431ba17d82fcc7b221e63a8d8c,"thermal: exynos: Remove check for thermal device pointer at exynos_report_trigger()

The commit 4de0bdaa9677d11406c9becb70c60887c957e1f0
(""thermal: exynos: Add support for instance based register/unregister"")
broke check for presence of therm_dev at global thermal zone in
exynos_report_trigger().

The resulting wrong test prevents thermal_zone_device_update() call, which
calls handlers for situation when trip points are passed.
Such behavior prevents thermal driver from proper reaction (when TMU interrupt
is raised) in a situation when overheating is detected at TMU hardware.

It turns out, that after exynos thermal subsystem redesign (at v3.12) this
check is not needed, since it is not possible to register thermal zone
without valid thermal device.

Taeung/tip,c65c7a306610ee7c13669a8f5601b472c19dc6f1,"bridge: notify user space after fdb update

There has been a number incidents recently where customers running KVM have
reported that VM hosts on different Hypervisors are unreachable. Based on
pcap traces we found that the bridge was broadcasting the ARP request out
onto the network. However some NICs have an inbuilt switch which on occasions
were broadcasting the VMs ARP request back through the physical NIC on the
Hypervisor. This resulted in the bridge changing ports and incorrectly learning
that the VMs mac address was external. As a result the ARP reply was directed
back onto the external network and VM never updated it's ARP cache. This patch
will notify the bridge command, after a fdb has been updated to identify such
port toggling.

Taeung/tip,454c79999f7eaedcdf4c15c449e43902980cbdf5,"sched/rt: Fix SCHED_RR across cgroups

task_tick_rt() has an optimization to only reschedule SCHED_RR tasks
if they were the only element on their rq.  However, with cgroups
a SCHED_RR task could be the only element on its per-cgroup rq but
still be competing with other SCHED_RR tasks in its parent's
cgroup.  In this case, the SCHED_RR task in the child cgroup would
never yield at the end of its timeslice.  If the child cgroup
rt_runtime_us was the same as the parent cgroup rt_runtime_us,
the task in the parent cgroup would starve completely.

Modify task_tick_rt() to check that the task is the only task on its
rq, and that the each of the scheduling entities of its ancestors
is also the only entity on its rq.

Due to the 80-cols restrictions, and latter due to checkpatch
warnings, several strings were broken into multiple lines. This
is not considered a good practice anymore, as it makes harder
to grep for strings at the source code.

As we're right now fixing other drivers due to KERN_CONT, we need
to be able to identify what printk strings don't end with a ""\n"".
It is a way easier to detect those if we don't break long lines.

So, join those continuation lines.

The patch was generated via the script below, and manually
adjusted if needed.

blkcg_bio_issue_check. This also makes blktrace outputs correct cgroup

In Geminilake, the DDI IO power domains can't be enabled before a DPLL
is running and mapped to the appropriate DDI. At least on Geminilake,
attempting to enable those during init will lead to a timeout.

The failure to enable the power domain also causes issues with the state
verifier during resume from suspend. After all the init power domains
are enabled, the call to intel_power_domains_sync_hw() from the resume
path will cause the hw_enabled field on the respective power wells to be
false while the usage count remains above zero. Further attempts to
enable the power domain caused by a modeset will simply update the usage
count without doing anything else. When the state verifier attempts to
read the state of a DDI encoder, intel_display_power_get_if_enabled()
returns false, leading to the following WARN:

command line can override the one provided by the boot loader, for
those cases where the boot loader is broken or it is difficult
to change the command line in the the boot loader.

OK. This version changes absolutely nothing if CONFIG_CMDLINE_BOOL is not
set (the default).  Also, no space is appended even when CONFIG_CMDLINE_BOOL
is set, but the builtin string is empty.  This is less sloppy all the way
around, IMHO.

Note that I use the same option names as on other arches for
this feature.

On AP4EVB the card detect pin of the top SD/MMC slot is not directly
connected to the tmio/mmcif controller but to a GPIO pin, so polling
needs to be done for SDHI1 and MMCIF in order to support hotplug for
that slot. SHDI1 and MMCIF share that slot, and the used controller
is selected by a DIP switch.
This patch adds a helper function to check if a card is present in that
particular slot, registers this function with SDHI1 and MMCIF and enables
polling for SDHI1.

Taeung/tip,024ca329bfb9a948f76eaff3243e21b7e70182f2,"serial: uartps: Register own uart console and driver structures

Every instance is registering own struct console and struct uart_driver
with minor number which corresponds to alias ID (or 0 now) and with 1 uart
port. The same alias ID is saved to tty_driver->name_base which is key
field for creating ttyPSX name.

Because name_base and minor number are setup already there is no need to
setup any port->line number because 0 is the right value.

Unfortunately this driver is setting up major number to 0 for using
dynamic assignment and kernel is allocating different major numbers for
every instance instead of using the same major and different minor
number.

~# ls -la /dev/ttyPS*
crw-------    1 root     root      252,   0 Jan  1 03:36 /dev/ttyPS0
crw--w----    1 root     root      253,   1 Jan  1 00:00 /dev/ttyPS1

When major number is not 0. For example 252 then major/minor
combinations are in expected form

~# ls -la /dev/ttyPS*
crw-------    1 root     root      252,   0 Jan  1 04:04 /dev/ttyPS0
crw--w----    1 root     root      252,   1 Jan  1 00:00 /dev/ttyPS1

Driver is not freeing struct cdns_uart_console in case that instance is
not used as console. The reason is that console is incorrectly unregistred
and ""console [0] disabled"" message will be shown.

The log->next index for the transaction log was

case where log->next++ resulted in an index

Memblock list is another source for usable system memory layout.
So move powerpc's arch_kexec_walk_mem() to common code so that other
memblock-based architectures, particularly arm64, can also utilise it.
A moved function is now renamed to kexec_walk_memblock() and integrated
into kexec_locate_mem_hole(), which will now be usable for all
architectures with no need for overriding arch_kexec_walk_mem().

With this change, arch_kexec_walk_mem() need no longer be a weak function,
and was now renamed to kexec_walk_resources().

Since powerpc doesn't support kdump in its kexec_file_load(), the current
kexec_walk_memblock() won't work for kdump either in this form, this will
be fixed in the next patch.

This patch series adds the following.
Discard packet if length is greater than MTU, move sge monitor code to a
new routine, add device node to ULD info, add congestion notification from
SGE for ingress queue and freelists and for T5, setting up the Congestion
Manager values of the new RX Ethernet Queue is done by firmware now.

This patch series has been created against net-next tree and includes
patches on cxgb4 driver.

We copy vnet header unconditionally in page_to_skb() this is wrong
since XDP may modify the packet data. So let's keep a zeroed vnet
header for not confusing the conversion between vnet header and skb
metadata.

In the future, we should able to detect whether or not the packet was
modified and keep using the vnet header when packet was not touched.

In P_Key event handling, if the old P_Key is no longer available, the
driver must call ipoib_ib_dev_stop() -- just as it does when the P_Key
is still available (see procedure __ipoib_ib_dev_flush()).

When a P_Key becomes available, the driver will perform ipoib_open(),
which assumes that the QP is in RESET, the cm_id has been
destroyed/deleted, etc.  If ipoib_ib_dev_stop() is not called as
described above, then these assumptions will be false, and the attempt
to bring the interface up will fail.

Taeung/tip,822c2621daadcf9e8fa8f11f7334e3c349434154,"perf bpf: Include uapi/linux/bpf.h from the 'perf trace' script's bpf.h

The next example scripts need the definition for the BPF functions, i.e.
things like BPF_FUNC_probe_read, and in time will require lots of other
definitions found in uapi/linux/bpf.h, so include it from the bpf.h file
included from the eBPF scripts build with clang via '-e bpf_script.c'
like in this example:

  $ tail -8 tools/perf/examples/bpf/5sec.c
  #include <bpf.h>

  int probe(hrtimer_nanosleep, rqtp->tv_sec)(void *ctx, int err, long sec)
  {
	return sec == 5;
  }

  license(GPL);
  $

That 'bpf.h' include in the 5sec.c eBPF example will come from a set of
header files crafted for building eBPF objects, that in a end-user
system will come from:

  /usr/lib/perf/include/bpf/bpf.h

And will include <uapi/linux/bpf.h> either from the place where the
kernel was built, or from a kernel-devel rpm package like:

  -working-directory /lib/modules/4.17.9-100.fc27.x86_64/build

That is set up by tools/perf/util/llvm-utils.c, and can be overriden
by setting the 'kbuild-dir' variable in the ""llvm"" ~/.perfconfig file,
like:

  # cat ~/.perfconfig
  [llvm]
       kbuild-dir = /home/foo/git/build/linux

This usually doesn't need any change, just documenting here my findings
while working with this code.

In the future we may want to instead just use what is in
/usr/include/linux/bpf.h, that comes from the UAPI provided from the
kernel sources, for now, to avoid getting the kernel's non-UAPI
""linux/bpf.h"" file, that will cause clang to fail and is not what we
want anyway (no BPF function definitions, etc), do it explicitely by
asking for ""uapi/linux/bpf.h"".

In the commit [fa4f18b4f402: ALSA: hda - Refresh widgets sysfs at
probing Haswell+ HDMI codecs], snd_hdac_refresh_widget_sysfs() is
explicitly called in the codec driver.  But this results in refreshing
twice, as snd_hdac_refresh_widget_sysfs() itself calls
snd_hdac_refresh_widgets() function.

Instead, we can replace the call in snd_hda_codec_update_widgets()

sysfs update for ca0132, too.

With the introduction of the new unified work queue thread pools,
we lost one feature: It's no longer possible to know which worker

similar in style to the timer/hrtimer tracepoints.

report which work item caused the wakeup (and how long it took):

/home/edwin/builds/linux-2.6/arch/x86/include/asm/string_64.h:61:

Expand the parameter parsing for block2mtd.  It now accepts:
Ki, Mi, Gi	- the official prefixes for binary multiples,
		  see http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html,
ki		- mistake on my side and analog to ""k"" for decimal multiples,
KiB, MiB, GiB	- for people that prefer to add a ""B"" for byte,
kiB		- combination of the above.

There were complaints about not accepting ""k"" for 1024.  This has long
been common practice, but is known to lead to confusion.  Hence the new
SI units and hence block2mtd only accepts units that cannot be confused
with decimal units.  Diverging from common practice doesn't always please
people, even if the change is for the better.

    drm: add object property typ

I asked for a check to make sure that we never leak an fb from the
generic mode object lookup since those have completely different
lifetime rules. Rob added it, but outside of the idr mutex, which
means that our dereference of obj->type can already chase free'd
memory.

Somehow I didn't spot this, so fix this asap.

v2: Simplify the conditionals as suggested by Chris.

The DS4 motion sensors are currently mapped by the hid-core driver
to non-existing axes in between ABS_MISC and ABS_MT_SLOT, because
the device already exhausted ABS_X-ABS_RZ. For a part the mapping
by hid-core is accomplished by a fixup in hid-sony as the motion
axes actually use vendor specific usage pages.

This patch makes the DS4 use a separate input device for the motion
sensors and reports acceleration data through ABS_X-ABS_Z and
gyroscope data through ABS_RX-ABS_RZ. In addition it extends the
event spec to allow gyroscope data through ABS_RX-ABS_RZ when
INPUT_PROP_ACCELEROMETER is set. This change was suggested by
Peter Hutterer during a discussion on linux-input.

Ignore client writing state during cb completion to fix a memory
leak.

When moving cbs to the completion list we should not look at
writing_state as this state can be already overwritten by next
write, the fact that a cb is on the write waiting list means
that it was already written to the HW and we can safely complete it.

Same pays for wait in poll handler, we do not have to check the state

Some linux customers want to optimize their applications on the latest
hardware but are not yet willing to upgrade to the latest kernel. This
patch provides a way to plug in an alternate, basic, and GPL'ed PMU
subsystem to help with their monitoring needs or for specialty work. It
can also be used in case of serious unexpected bugs in perfmon. Mutual
exclusion between the two subsystems is guaranteed, hence no conflict
can arise from both subsystem being present.

Taeung/tip,cf4c7c12258ed9367f4fc45238f5f50d2db892c1,"drm/i915: Make all plane disables use 'update_plane' (v5)

If we extend the commit_plane handlers for each plane type to be able to
handle fb=0, then we can easily implement plane disable via the
update_plane handler.  The cursor plane already works this way, and this
is the direction we need to go to integrate with the atomic plane
handler.  We can now kill off the type-specific disable functions, as
well as the redundant intel_plane_disable() (not to be confused with
intel_disable_plane()).

Note that prepare_plane_fb() only gets called as part of update_plane
when fb!=NULL (by design, to match the semantics of the atomic plane
helpers); this means that our commit_plane handlers need to handle the
frontbuffer tracking for the disable case, even though they don't handle
it for normal updates.

v2:
 - Change BUG_ON to WARN_ON (Ander/Daniel)

v3:
 - Drop unnecessary plane->crtc check since a previous patch to plane
   update ensures that plane->crtc will always be non-NULL, even for
   disable calls that might pass NULL from userspace.  (Ander)
 - Drop a s/crtc/plane->crtc/ hunk that was unnecessary.  (Ander)

v4:
 - Fix missing whitespace (Ander)

v5:
 - Use state's crtc rather than plane's crtc in
   intel_check_primary_plane().  plane->crtc could be NULL, but we've
   already fixed up state->crtc to ensure it's non-NULL (even if
   userspace passed it as NULL during a disable call).  (Ander)

Taeung/tip,3dfc35ffd938abe67f2559db6b517536a207df24,"PM / AVS: SmartReflex: use omap_sr * for errgen interfaces

SmartReflex driver interface is natively divided to two parts:

- external SmartReflex interface
- interface between SmartReflex driver and SmartReflex Class

Functions which belong to AVS class interface can use
struct omap_sr* instead of struct voltatedomain*, to provide a
direct connection between SR driver and SR class. This allows
us to optimize and not do additional lookups where none is
required.

sr_disable_errgen() and sr_configure_errgen() are interface
functions between SR driver and SR class. They are typically
used by Class driver to configure error generator module during
SmartReflex enable/disable sequence.
Now they take struct omap_sr* as input parameter.

With l4 interconnect hierarchy and ti-sysc interconnect target module
data in place, we can simply move all the related child devices to
their proper location and enable probing using ti-sysc.

In general the first child device address range starts at range 0
from the ti-sysc interconnect target so the move involves adjusting
the child device reg properties for that.

In case of any regressions, problem devices can be reverted to probe
with legacy platform data as needed by moving them back and removing
the related interconnect target module node.

Note that we are not yet moving dss or wkup_m3, those will be moved
later after some related driver changes.

Pingmin/linux,674c242c9323d3c293fc4f9a3a3a619fe3063290,"arm64: flush FP/SIMD state correctly after execve()

When a task calls execve(), its FP/SIMD state is flushed so that
none of the original program state is observeable by the incoming
program.

However, since this flushing consists of setting the in-memory copy
of the FP/SIMD state to all zeroes, the CPU field is set to CPU 0 as
well, which indicates to the lazy FP/SIMD preserve/restore code that
the FP/SIMD state does not need to be reread from memory if the task
is scheduled again on CPU 0 without any other tasks having entered
userland (or used the FP/SIMD in kernel mode) on the same CPU in the
mean time. If this happens, the FP/SIMD state of the old program will
still be present in the registers when the new program starts.

So set the CPU field to the invalid value of NR_CPUS when performing
the flush, by calling fpsimd_flush_task_state().

This hooks up throttle/unthrottle to properly toggle the RTS line or do

Note, if the UART itself can handle XON/XOFF, we would need to send the
correct character down to it, to have the firmware in the device set up
the chip to use it automatically when needed.  The odds of someone
wanting to use this type of flow control is slim, so this isn't
implemented at this point in time.

Pingmin/linux,3e6c3b0fd5d071ed17bf91586aae35a6cfb8cdb3,"IB/hfi1: Fix SGE length for misaligned PIO copy

When trying to align the source pointer and there's a byte carry
in an SGE copy, bytes are borrowed from the next quad-word X to
complete the required quad-word copy. Then, the SGE length is
reduced by the number of borrowed bytes. After this, if the
remaining number of bytes from quad-word X (extra bytes) is
greater than the new SGE length, the number of extra bytes needs
to be updated to the new SGE length. Otherwise, when the
SGE length gets updated again after the extra bytes are read to
create the new byte carry, it goes negative, which then becomes
a very large number as the SGE length is an unsigned integer.
This causes SGE buffer to be over-read.

TTM was changed a while back to allow for pipelining of buffer moves, and
part of this was the removal of waiting for a BO to idle before calling
move(), placing the responsibility on the driver to do this if required.

That's all well and good, except, we make use of move_notify() to handle
mapping/unmapping from the GPU VMM as move() isn't called on all paths.

This commit adds a wait before unmapping from a VMM in move_notify(), to
prevent GPU page faults where a buffer is still being accessed.

Some users have been reporting issues with thunderbolt being turned off
before fully initialized. This is suspected to be caused by userspace
turning off the Thunderbolt controller using intel-wmi-thunderbolt
prematurely.

Userspace has already made some mitigations for this situation:
https://github.com/hughsie/fwupd/commit/ef6f1d76983c9b66
https://github.com/hughsie/fwupd/commit/c07ce5b4889a5384

To allow easier debugging of this situation add output that can be turned
on with dynamic debugging to better root cause this problem.

Pingmin/linux,b05c950698fe1edb1d67a00ecd034754e7dad8bb,"pstore/ram: Simplify ramoops_get_next_prz() arguments

(1) remove type argument from ramoops_get_next_prz()

Since we store the type of the prz when we initialize it, we no longer
need to pass it again in ramoops_get_next_prz() since we can just use
that to setup the pstore record. So lets remove it from the argument list.

(2) remove max argument from ramoops_get_next_prz()

Looking at the code flow, the 'max' checks are already being done on
the prz passed to ramoops_get_next_prz(). Lets remove it to simplify
this function and reduce its arguments.

(3) further reduce ramoops_get_next_prz() arguments by passing record

Both the id and type fields of a pstore_record are set by
ramoops_get_next_prz(). So we can just pass a pointer to the pstore_record
instead of passing individual elements. This results in cleaner more
readable code and fewer lines.

In addition lets also remove the 'update' argument since we can detect
that. Changes are squashed into a single patch to reduce fixup conflicts.

An SLB entry contains two pieces of information related to size:

  2) SLB size

The L bit defines the PTE be ""large"" (usually means 16MB),
SLB_VSID_B_1T defines that the SLB should span 1 GB instead of the
default 256MB.

Apparently I messed things up and just put those two in one box,
shaked it heavily and came up with the current code which handles
large pages incorrectly, because it also treats large page SLB entries
as ""1TB"" segment entries.

This patch splits those two features apart, making Linux guests boot
even when they have > 256MB.

Previous commit adds support for some devices which can capture PCM samples.
These devices transmit AMDTP stream in non-blocking mode. This commit adds
functionality to handle AMDTP incoming stream.

OXFW seems to have two quirks:
 - Transmits packets with non-zero dbc in its beginning
 - Transmits packets with wrong values in syt field

For the first quirk, this commit adds CIP_SKIP_INIT_DBC_CHECK flag for
incoming stream to skip first check of dbc.

For the second quirk, this commit doesn't add duplex stream which
Fireworks/BeBoB drivers use. So OXFW driver generates syt value for outgoing
stream.

Here are examples of a sequence of packets transmitted by Behringer F-Control
Audio 202. There are differences between sequences of syt value when OXFW
driver transfers outgoing stream or not.

When driver gives no outgoing stream:

Pingmin/linux,95dcd64bc5a27080beaa344edfe5bdcca3d2e7dc,"hwmon: (pwm-fan) Set fan speed to 0 on suspend

Technically this is not required because disabling the PWM should be
enough. However, when support for atomic operations was implemented in
the PWM subsystem, only actual changes to the PWM channel are applied
during pwm_config(), which means that during after resume from suspend
the old settings won't be applied.

One possible solution is for the PWM driver to implement its own PM
operations such that settings from before suspend get applied on resume.
This has the disadvantage of completely ignoring any particular ordering
requirements that PWM user drivers might have, so it is best to leave it
up to the user drivers to apply the settings that they want at the
appropriate time.

Another way to solve this would be to read back the current state of the
PWM at the time of resume. That way, in case the configuration was lost
during suspend, applying the old settings in PWM user drivers would
actually get them applied because they differ from the current settings.
However, not all PWM drivers support reading the hardware state, and not
all hardware may support it.

The best workaround at this point seems to be to let PWM user drivers
tell the PWM subsystem that the PWM is turned off by, in addition to
disabling it, also setting the duty cycle to 0. This causes the resume
operation to apply a configuration that is different from the current
configuration, resulting in the proper state from before suspend getting
restored.

Our gluster boxes were spending lots of time in statfs because our fs'es are
huge.  The problem is statfs loops through all of the block groups looking for
read only block groups, and when you have several terabytes worth of data that
ends up being a lot of block groups.  Move the read only block groups onto a
read only list and only proces that list in
btrfs_account_ro_block_groups_free_space to reduce the amount of churn.  Thanks,

Commit d13ba512cbba7de5d55d7a3b2aae7d83c8921457 (""tg3: Remove
SPEED_UNKNOWN checks"") cleaned up the autoneg advertisement by
removing some dead code. One effect of this change was that the
advertisement register would not be updated if autoneg is turned off.

This exposed a bug on the 5715 device w.r.t linking. The 5715 defaults
to advertise only 10Mb Full duplex. But with autoneg disabled, it needs
the configured speed enabled in the advertisement register to link up.

This patch adds the work around to advertise all speeds on the 5715 when
autoneg is disabled.

The array data is only populated with valid information from userspace
if cmd != SIOCDEVPRIVATE, other cases the array contains garbage on
the stack. The subsequent switch statement acts on a subcommand in
data[0] which could be any garbage value if cmd is SIOCDEVPRIVATE which
seems incorrect to me.  Instead, just return EOPNOTSUPP for the case
where cmd == SIOCDEVPRIVATE to avoid this issue.

As a side note, I suspect that the original intention of the code
was for this ioctl to work just for cmd == SIOCDEVPRIVATE (and the
current logic is reversed). However, I don't wont to change the current
semantics in case any userspace code relies on this existing behaviour.

Au1x00/RT2800+ hardware has an alternate register layout which is

However, the h/w does not support the complete 8250 register set, and
accesses to unmapped registers cause out-of-bounds lookups. Further,
because the lookup tables are defined by designated initializers, the
tables may contain unmapped entries (although the current tables do not).

Declare fixed-size lookup tables with contiguous initialization for
the complete 8250 register map; unmapped registers are initialized to -1.
Validate the register index (ie., 'offset') is in the range [0, table size).
Return fixed value for unmapped register reads and ignore unmapped register

to a particular IP.

-> No extra cost for typical setups, where the first lookup will probabbly
be performed.

RCU lookups everywhere, we dont acquire spinlock.

Previously inet devices were only constructed when addresses are added.
Therefore the default neigh parms values they get are the ones at the
time of these operations.

Now that we're creating inet devices earlier, this changes the behaviour
of default neigh parms values in an incompatible way (see bug #8519).

This patch creates a compromise by setting the default values at the
same point as before but only for those that have not been explicitly
set by the user since the inet device's creation.

David Howells says:

====================
rxrpc: Get rid of conn bundle and transport structs

Here's the next part of the AF_RXRPC rewrite.  The primary purpose of this
set is to get rid of the rxrpc_conn_bundle and rxrpc_transport structs.
This simplifies things for future development of the connection handling.

To this end, the following significant changes are made:

 (1) The rxrpc_connection struct is given pointers to the local and peer
     endpoints, inside the rxrpc_conn_parameters struct.  Pointers to the
     transport's copy of these pointers are then redirected to the
     connection struct.

 (2) Exclusive connection handling is fixed.  Exclusive connections should
     do just one call and then be retired.  They are used in security
     negotiations and, I believe, the idea is to avoid reuse of negotiated
     security contexts.

     The current code is doing a single connection per socket and doing all
     the calls over that.  With this change it gets a new connection for
     each call made.

 (3) A new sendmsg() control message marker is added to make individual
     calls operate over exclusive connections.  This should be used in
     future in preference to the sockopt that marks a socket as ""exclusive
     connection"".

 (4) IDs for client connections initiated by a machine are now allocated
     from a global pool using the IDR facility and are unique across all
     client connections, no matter their destination.  The IDR facility is
     then used to look up a connection on the connection ID alone.  Other
     parameters are then verified afterwards.

     Note that the IDR facility may use a lot of memory if the IDs it holds
     are widely scattered.  Given this, in a future commit, client
     connections will be retired if they are more than a certain distance
     from the last ID allocated.

     The client epoch is advanced by 1 each time the client ID counter
     wraps.  Connections outside the current epoch will also be retired in
     a future commit.

 (5) The connection bundle concept is removed and the client connection
     tree is moved into the local endpoint.  The queue for waiting for a
     call channel is moved to the rxrpc_connection struct as there can only
     be one connection for any particular key going to any particular peer
     now.

 (6) The rxrpc_transport struct is removed and the service connection tree
     is moved into the peer struct.

For ums driver there's only r128 and radeon which support vblank, and

we just return if *any* IRQ is active on the VCPU in question.

This is of course bogus, as we should check if the specific IRQ in

bond_update_speed_duplex() when we receive NETDEV_UP, however,

The ACPI 4.0 specification has been changed to make the SyncLevel
for mutex objects more useful. When releasing a mutex, the
synclevel of the mutex must now be the same as the current sync

match the spec.

David Howells says:

====================
rxrpc: Get rid of conn bundle and transport structs

Here's the next part of the AF_RXRPC rewrite.  The primary purpose of this
set is to get rid of the rxrpc_conn_bundle and rxrpc_transport structs.
This simplifies things for future development of the connection handling.

To this end, the following significant changes are made:

 (1) The rxrpc_connection struct is given pointers to the local and peer
     endpoints, inside the rxrpc_conn_parameters struct.  Pointers to the
     transport's copy of these pointers are then redirected to the
     connection struct.

 (2) Exclusive connection handling is fixed.  Exclusive connections should
     do just one call and then be retired.  They are used in security
     negotiations and, I believe, the idea is to avoid reuse of negotiated
     security contexts.

     The current code is doing a single connection per socket and doing all
     the calls over that.  With this change it gets a new connection for
     each call made.

 (3) A new sendmsg() control message marker is added to make individual
     calls operate over exclusive connections.  This should be used in
     future in preference to the sockopt that marks a socket as ""exclusive
     connection"".

 (4) IDs for client connections initiated by a machine are now allocated
     from a global pool using the IDR facility and are unique across all
     client connections, no matter their destination.  The IDR facility is
     then used to look up a connection on the connection ID alone.  Other
     parameters are then verified afterwards.

     Note that the IDR facility may use a lot of memory if the IDs it holds
     are widely scattered.  Given this, in a future commit, client
     connections will be retired if they are more than a certain distance
     from the last ID allocated.

     The client epoch is advanced by 1 each time the client ID counter
     wraps.  Connections outside the current epoch will also be retired in
     a future commit.

 (5) The connection bundle concept is removed and the client connection
     tree is moved into the local endpoint.  The queue for waiting for a
     call channel is moved to the rxrpc_connection struct as there can only
     be one connection for any particular key going to any particular peer
     now.

 (6) The rxrpc_transport struct is removed and the service connection tree
     is moved into the peer struct.

Drivers really have no business touching these. Noticed because
exynose _did_ touch the vblank off delay, which could potentially
affect other drivers.

drm_debug is an exception since it's used in macros and inline

Note that this reduces the timeout on exynos from 50s to 5s.
Apparently this was done to paper over a vblank get/put race in
exynos, but really should be fixed properly somewhere else. Spotted by
David.

Convert i2c-isa from a dumb i2c_adapter into a pseudo i2c-core for ISA
hardware monitoring drivers. The isa i2c_adapter is no more registered
with i2c-core, drivers have to explicitely connect to it using the new
i2c_isa_{add,del}_driver interface.

At this point, all ISA chip drivers are useless, because they still
register with i2c-core in the hope i2c-isa is registered there as well,
but it isn't anymore.

The fake bus will be named i2c-9191 in sysfs. This is the number it
already had internally in various places, so it's not exactly new,
except that now the number is seen in userspace as well. This shouldn't
be a problem until someone really has 9192 I2C busses in a given system
;)

The fake bus will no more show in ""i2cdetect -l"", as it won't be seen by
i2c-dev anymore (not being registered with i2c-core), which is a good
thing, as i2cdetect/i2cdump/i2cset cannot operate on this fake bus
anyway.

With some enclosures when LUN 0 is not created but LUN 1 or LUN X is created
then SCSI scan procedure calls target_alloc, slave_alloc call back functions
for LUN 0 and slave_destory() for same LUN 0.

In these kind of cases within slave_destroy, pointer to scsi_target in
_sas_device structure is set to NULL, following which when slave_alloc for LUN
1 is called then starget would not be set properly for this LUN.  So,
scsi_target pointer pointing to NULL value would lead to a crash later in the
discovery procedure.

To solve this issue set the sas_device's scsi_target pointer to scsi_device's
scsi_target if it is NULL earlier in slave_alloc callback function.

gazoo74/linux,24ec84e854c68ceda59a26027114eb7f260f9411,"drm/omap: Move DISPC runtime PM handling to omapdrm

The internal encoders (DSI, HDMI4, HDMI5 and VENC) runtime PM handlers
attempt to manage the runtime PM state of the connected DISPC, based on
the rationale that the DISPC providing data to the encoders requires
ensuring that the display is active whenever the encoders are active.

While the DISPC provides data to the encoders, it doesn't as such
constitute a resource that encoders require in order to be taken out
of suspend, contrary to for instance a functional clock or a power
supply. Encoders registers can be accessed without the DISPC being
active, and while the encoders will not output any video stream without
being fed by the DISPC, the DISPC PM state doesn't influence the
encoders PM state.

For this reason the DISPC PM state is better managed from the omapdrm
driver, in the CRTC enable and disable operations. This allows the
encoders PM state to be handled separately from the DISPC, and in
particular at times when the DISPC may not be available (for instance at
probe due to the DSS probe being deferred, or at remove time du to the

On year ago Rob Herring wanted to remove the data pointer from the
device_node structure[1]. The mvneta driver seemed to be the only one
which used (abused ?) it. However, the proposal of Rob to remove this
pointer from the driver introduced a regression, and I tested and fixed an
alternative way, but it was never submitted as a proper patch.

Now here it is: Instead of using the device_node structure ->data
pointer, we store the BM private data as the driver data of the BM
platform_device. The core mvneta code can retrieve it by doing a lookup
on which platform_device corresponds to the BM device tree node using
of_find_device_by_node(), and get its driver data

====================
Full phylink support for mv88e6352

These two patches implement full phylink support for the mv88e6352
family, when using an SFP connected to its SERDES interface. This adds
interrupt support to the SERDES, so that we get interrupts on link
up/down, and then make calls phydev_link_change().

The first patch is a minor bug fix, which does not seem to affect any
current features, so i'm not submitting it for stable. It is however
required for configuring SERDES interrupts.

The current global pending command list in mgmt.c is racy. Possibly the
simplest way to fix it is to have per-hci dev lists instead of a global
one (all commands that need a pending struct are hci_dev specific).
This way the list can be protected using the already existing per-hci
dev lock. To enable this refactoring the first thing that needs to be
done is to ensure that the mgmt functions have access to the hci_dev
struct (instead of just the dev id).

gazoo74/linux,386c6ddbda180676b7d9fc375d54a7bdd353d39e,"X86/VMX: Disable VMX preemption timer if MWAIT is not intercepted

The VMX-preemption timer is used by KVM as a way to set deadlines for the
guest (i.e. timer emulation). That was safe till very recently when
capability KVM_X86_DISABLE_EXITS_MWAIT to disable intercepting MWAIT was
introduced. According to Intel SDM 25.5.1:

""""""
The VMX-preemption timer operates in the C-states C0, C1, and C2; it also
operates in the shutdown and wait-for-SIPI states. If the timer counts down
to zero in any state other than the wait-for SIPI state, the logical
processor transitions to the C0 C-state and causes a VM exit; the timer
does not cause a VM exit if it counts down to zero in the wait-for-SIPI
state. The timer is not decremented in C-states deeper than C2.
""""""

Now once the guest issues the MWAIT with a c-state deeper than
C2 the preemption timer will never wake it up again since it stopped
ticking! Usually this is compensated by other activities in the system that
would wake the core from the deep C-state (and cause a VMExit). For
example, if the host itself is ticking or it received interrupts, etc!

So disable the VMX-preemption timer if MWAIT is exposed to the guest!

This is because we hold the rtnl_lock() before ndo_change_mtu() and try to flush
the work in netvsc_change_mtu(), in the mean time, netdev_notify_peers() may be
called from worker and also trying to hold the rtnl_lock. This will lead the
flush won't succeed forever. Solve this by not canceling and flushing the work,
this is safe because the transmission done by NETDEV_NOTIFY_PEERS was
synchronized with the netif_tx_disable() called by netvsc_change_mtu().

If signal-driven i/o is disabled while write wakeup is pending (ie.,

minutes are reset to 0-9, jumping back in time 40 or 50 minutes.  The time

Tariq Toukan says:

====================
ethtool ringparam upper bound

This patchset by Jenny adds sanity checks in ethtool ringparam
operation for input upper bounds, similarly to what's done in
ethtool_set_channels.

The checks are added in patch 1, using a call to get_ringparam
prior to calling set_ringparam NDO.

Patch 2 changes the function's behavior in mlx4_en, so that
it returns an error for out-of-range input, instead of rounding
it to closest valid, similar to mlx5e.

Not a new type exposed to userspace, just a standard way to create
them since between range, bitmask and enum there's 3 different ways to
pull out a boolean prop.

Also add the kerneldoc for the recently added new prop types, which
Rob forgot all about.

v2: Fixup kerneldoc, spotted by Rob.

Prarit reported a crash on CPU offline/online. The reason is that on
CPU down the NOHZ related per cpu data of the dead cpu is not cleaned
up. If at cpu online an interrupt happens before the per cpu tick
device is registered the irq_enter() check potentially sees stale data
and dereferences a NULL pointer.

Cleanup the data after the cpu is dead.

Redirecting directly to lsm, here's the patch discussed on lkml:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/4/22/219

The mmap_min_addr value is useful information for an admin to see without
being root (""is my system vulnerable to kernel NULL pointer attacks?"") and
its setting is trivially easy for an attacker to determine by calling
mmap() in PAGE_SIZE increments starting at 0, so trying to keep it private
has no value.

Only require CAP_SYS_RAWIO if changing the value, not reading it.

Let's show locks which are associated with a file descriptor in
its fdinfo file.

Currently we don't have a reliable way to determine who holds a lock.  We
can find some information in /proc/locks, but PID which is reported there
can be wrong.  For example, a process takes a lock, then forks a child and
dies.  In this case /proc/locks contains the parent pid, which can be
reused by another process.

$ cat /proc/locks
...
6: FLOCK  ADVISORY  WRITE 324 00:13:13431 0 EOF
...

$ ps -C rpcbind
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
  332 ?        00:00:00 rpcbind

$ cat /proc/332/fdinfo/4
pos:	0
flags:	0100000
mnt_id:	22
lock:	1: FLOCK  ADVISORY  WRITE 324 00:13:13431 0 EOF

$ ls -l /proc/332/fd/4
lr-x------ 1 root root 64 Mar  5 14:43 /proc/332/fd/4 -> /run/rpcbind.lock

$ ls -l /proc/324/fd/
total 0
lrwx------ 1 root root 64 Feb 27 14:50 0 -> /dev/pts/0
lrwx------ 1 root root 64 Feb 27 14:50 1 -> /dev/pts/0
lrwx------ 1 root root 64 Feb 27 14:49 2 -> /dev/pts/0

You can see that the process with the 324 pid doesn't hold the lock.

This information is required for proper dumping and restoring file
locks.

The DSS private data structure is currently stored as a global variable.
While no platform with multiple DSS devices currently exists nor is
planned, this doesn't comply with the kernel device model and should
thus be fixed.

Allocate the DSS private data structure dynamically for each DSS
instance and remove the global variable. All code that need access to
the structure now retrieves it dynamically so we can remove the global
variable.

When an update interval is interrupted via key press (e.g. space), the
'Current' column value is calculated using the full interval length
instead of the elapsed time, which leads to lower than actual numbers.
Furthermore, the value should be rounded, not truncated.
This is fixed by using the actual elapsed time for the calculation.

Add device managed APIs for regmap_add_irq_chip() and
regmap_del_irq_chip() so that it can be managed by
device framework for freeing it.

This helps on following:
1. Maintaining the sequence of resource allocation and deallocation
	regmap_add_irq_chip(&d);
	devm_requested_threaded_irq(virq)

	On free path:
		regmap_del_irq_chip(d);
		and then removing the irq registration.

	On this case, regmap irq is deleted before the irq is free.
	This force to use normal irq registration.

	By using devm apis, the sequence can be maintain properly:
		devm_regmap_add_irq_chip(&d);
		devm_requested_threaded_irq(virq);

	and resource deallocation will be done in reverse order
	by device framework.

2. No need to delete the regmap_irq_chip in error path or remove
   callback and hence there is less code on this path.

The IPMI message handler relies on two defines which are the same -one in

#define IPMI_NUM_CHANNELS 0x10
and one in drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_msghandler.
#define IPMI_MAX_CHANNELS       16
These are used interchangeably in ipmi_msghandler.c, but since the array

uses IPMI_MAX_CHANNELS for all the checks for the array index.

NOTE: You could probably remove the line that defines IPMI_NUM_CHANNELS
from ipmi.h, or move IPMI_MAX_CHANNELS to ipmi.h

tracking - 597e1c3580b7 (mm/mmu_gather: enable tlb flush range in generic
mmu_gather), 2b047252d087 (Fix TLB gather virtual address range
invalidation corner cases) - and tlb_fast_mode() has been removed -
29eb77825cc7 (arch, mm: Remove tlb_fast_mode()).

The new mmu_gather structure is now suitable for arm64 and this patch
converts the arch asm/tlb.h to the generic code. One functional
difference is the shift_arg_pages() case where previously the code was
flushing the full mm (no tlb_start_vma call) but now it flushes the
range given to tlb_gather_mmu() (possibly slightly more efficient
previously).

Some userspace drivers and frameworks only poll and do not
require interrupts to be available and enabled on the
PCI device.  So remove the requirement that an IRQ is
assigned.  If an IRQ is not assigned and a userspace
driver tries to read()/write(), the generic uio
framework will just return -EIO.

This allows binding uio_pci_generic to devices which
cannot get an IRQ assigned, such as an NVMe controller
behind Intel Volume Management Device (VMD), since VMD
does not support INTx interrupts.

fwnode_graph_get_endpoint_by_id() is intended for obtaining local

fwnode_graph_get_endpoint_by_id() is slightly different from its OF
counterpart, of_graph_get_endpoint_by_regs(): instead of using -1 as
a value to indicate that a port or an endpoint number does not matter,
it uses flags to look for equal or greater endpoint. The port number
is always fixed. It also returns only remote endpoints that belong
to an available device, a behaviour that can be turned off with a flag.

openwrt-es/linux,1efccc9ddb98fd533169669160201b027562af7e,"NVMe: Fix blk-mq hot cpu notification

The driver may issue commands to a device that may never return, so its
request_queue could always have active requests while the controller is
running. Waiting for the queue to freeze could block forever, which is
what blk-mq's hot cpu notification handler was doing when nvme drives
were in use.

This has the nvme driver make the asynchronous event command's tag
reserved and does not keep the request active. We can't have more than
one since the request is released back to the request_queue before the
command is completed. Having only one avoids potential tag collisions,
and reserving the tag for this purpose prevents other admin tasks from
reusing the tag.

I also couldn't think of a scenario where issuing AEN requests single
depth is worse than issuing them in batches, so I don't think we lose
anything with this change.

As an added bonus, doing it this way removes ""Cancelling I/O"" warnings
observed when unbinding the nvme driver from a device.

Async hash API allows the use of HW acceleration for hash calculation.
It may give significant performance gain and/or reduce power consumption,
which might be very beneficial for battery powered devices.

This patch introduces hash calculation using ahash API. ahash performance
depends on the data size and the particular HW. Depending on the specific
system, shash performance may be better.

This patch defines 'ahash_minsize' module parameter, which is used to
define the minimal file size to use with ahash.  If this minimum file size
is not set or the file is smaller than defined by the parameter, shash will
be used.

Changes in v3:
- kernel parameter replaced with module parameter
- pr_crit replaced with pr_crit_ratelimited
- more comment changes - Mimi

Changes in v2:
- ima_ahash_size became as ima_ahash
- ahash pre-allocation moved out from __init code to be able to use
  ahash crypto modules. Ahash allocated once on the first use.
- hash calculation falls back to shash if ahash allocation/calculation fails
- complex initialization separated from variable declaration
- improved comments

team, ptp, xt_bpf, cls_bpf, etc. As such all users do their own
internal managment of obtaining filter blocks and thus already
have them in kernel memory and set up before calling into
sk_unattached_filter_create(). As a result, due to __user annotation
in sock_fprog, sparse triggers false positives (incorrect type in
assignment [different address space]) when filters are set up before
passing them to sk_unattached_filter_create(). Therefore, let
sk_unattached_filter_create() API use sock_fprog_kern to overcome
this issue.

The bytcr-rt5640 driver has a few quirk setups depending on the board,
where the quirk value is set by DMI matching.  When you have a new
device to add the support, you often experience to try the different
quirk by trial-and-error.  Or, you may have a development model that
still has no proper DMI string.  In either case, you'd need to compile
the driver at each time.

This patch introduces a module option to override the quirk value on
the fly.  User can boot like snd-soc-sst-bytcr-rt5640.quirk=0x4004 to
override the default value without recompilation.  It's a raw value,
so user needs to check the source code for the meaning of each bit.

openwrt-es/linux,3ccc3167b0e5d46ab3bf03e22fbdb7616ce038cd,"ext3: handle deleting corrupted indirect blocks

While freeing indirect blocks we attach a journal head to the parent
buffer head, free the blocks, then journal the parent.  If the indirect
block list is corrupted and points to the parent the journal head will be
detached when the block is cleared, causing an OOPS.

Check for that explicitly and handle it gracefully.

This patch fixes the third case (image hdb.20000057.nullderef.gz)
reported in http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10882.

Immediately above the change, in the ext3_free_data function, we call
ext3_clear_blocks to clear the indirect blocks in this parent block.  If
one of those blocks happens to actually be the parent block it will clear
b_private / BH_JBD.

I did the check at the end rather than earlier as it seemed more elegant.
I don't think there should be much practical difference, although it is
possible the FS may not be quite so badly corrupted if we did it the other
way (and didn't clear the block at all).  To be honest, I'm not convinced
there aren't other similar failure modes lurking in this code, although I
couldn't find any with a quick review.

Neither of these drivers has ever been anywhere near the iio abi.
Probably as a result of this the fact they had two event groups
each was not picked up when we restricted IIO to having only
1 event line per device (as part of the chrdev merge set).

As such these definitely didn't work before.  This patch squishes
the only element from the 'comparator' event line that isn't in the
'interrupt' one into it and kills off the 'comparator' one.

Ultimately both of these drivers belong in hwmon not IIO and are just
waiting here because I don't want to kill off a driver that may
prove useful to someone.  (Ultimately I will ask Greg to scrap
these two if no one steps up to deal with them.)

openwrt-es/linux,ba1c813a6b9a0ef14d7112daf51270eff326f037,"hw-breakpoints: Arbitrate access to pmu following registers constraints

Allow or refuse to build a counter using the breakpoints pmu following
given constraints.

We keep track of the pmu users by using three per cpu variables:

- nr_cpu_bp_pinned stores the number of pinned cpu breakpoints counters
  in the given cpu

- nr_bp_flexible stores the number of non-pinned breakpoints counters
  in the given cpu.

- task_bp_pinned stores the number of pinned task breakpoints in a cpu

The latter is not a simple counter but gathers the number of tasks that
have n pinned breakpoints.
Considering HBP_NUM the number of available breakpoint address
registers:
   task_bp_pinned[0] is the number of tasks having 1 breakpoint
   task_bp_pinned[1] is the number of tasks having 2 breakpoints
   [...]
   task_bp_pinned[HBP_NUM - 1] is the number of tasks having the
   maximum number of registers (HBP_NUM).

When a breakpoint counter is created and wants an access to the pmu,
we evaluate the following constraints:

== Non-pinned counter ==

- If attached to a single cpu, check:

    (per_cpu(nr_bp_flexible, cpu) || (per_cpu(nr_cpu_bp_pinned, cpu)
         + max(per_cpu(task_bp_pinned, cpu)))) < HBP_NUM

       -> If there are already non-pinned counters in this cpu, it
          means there is already a free slot for them.
          Otherwise, we check that the maximum number of per task
          breakpoints (for this cpu) plus the number of per cpu
          breakpoint (for this cpu) doesn't cover every registers.

- If attached to every cpus, check:

    (per_cpu(nr_bp_flexible, *) || (max(per_cpu(nr_cpu_bp_pinned, *))
           + max(per_cpu(task_bp_pinned, *)))) < HBP_NUM

       -> This is roughly the same, except we check the number of per
          cpu bp for every cpu and we keep the max one. Same for the
          per tasks breakpoints.

== Pinned counter ==

- If attached to a single cpu, check:

       ((per_cpu(nr_bp_flexible, cpu) > 1)
            + per_cpu(nr_cpu_bp_pinned, cpu)
            + max(per_cpu(task_bp_pinned, cpu))) < HBP_NUM

       -> Same checks as before. But now the nr_bp_flexible, if any,
          must keep one register at least (or flexible breakpoints will
          never be be fed).

- If attached to every cpus, check:

      ((per_cpu(nr_bp_flexible, *) > 1)
           + max(per_cpu(nr_cpu_bp_pinned, *))
           + max(per_cpu(task_bp_pinned, *))) < HBP_NUM

Changes in v2:

- Counter -> event rename

Changes in v5:

- Fix unreleased non-pinned task-bound-only counters. We only released
  it in the first cpu. (Thanks to Paul Mackerras for reporting that)

Changes in v6:

- Currently, events scheduling are done in this order: cpu context
  pinned + cpu context non-pinned + task context pinned + task context
  non-pinned events. Then our current constraints are right theoretically

The iommu-dma layer does its own size-alignment for coherent DMA
allocations based on IOMMU page sizes, but we still need to consider
CPU page sizes for the cases where a non-cacheable CPU mapping is
created. Whilst everything on the alloc/map path seems to implicitly
align things enough to make it work, some functions used by the
corresponding unmap/free path do not, which leads to problems freeing
odd-sized allocations. Either way it's something we really should be
handling explicitly, so do that to make both paths suitably robust.

Resume path calls .open but suspend path cannot call .stop because
fdirs should not be freed and control over hardware should not be
released until WoL is configured.  To avoid having to duplicate all
changes made in .stop on suspend path split out part of .stop that
is relevant during suspend and call it from .stop and during suspend.

This fix also ensures that ixgbe_ptp_suspend is called during the
suspend path, and helps avoid similar errors. We can't call

uniphier/linux-unph,50ec5babd3b9da274ac3e0d5ca0c4772e3c7bc8d,"[SCSI] pm8001: Fix possible racing condition.

There is a possble racing scenario.

'process_oq' is called by two routines, as shown below.

pm8001_8001_dispatch = {
         .......

        .isr             = pm8001_chip_isr --> process_oq,// A
        .isr_process_oq  = process_oq,                   //  B
        .....
}

process_oq() --> process_one_iomb() --> mpi_sata_completion()

In 'mpi_sata_completion', ""pm8001_ha->lock"" is first released.
It means lock is taken before,  which is true for
the context A, as 'pm8001_ha->lock' is taken in 'pm8001_chip_isr()'

But for context B there is no lock taken before and pm8001_ha->lock
is unlocked in 'mpi_sata_completion()'. This may unlock the lock
taken in context A. Possible racing ??

If 'pm8001_ha->lock' is taken in 'process_oq()' instead of
'pm8001_chip_isr' then the above issue can be avoided.

Note that a socket that is bound to certain ifindex/queue index will

This patch is inspired by the discussion at
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/11/187 and implements per cgroup statistics
as suggested by Andrew Morton in http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/11/263.  The
patch is on top of 2.6.21-mm1 with Paul's cgroups v9 patches (forward
ported)

This patch implements per cgroup statistics infrastructure and re-uses
code from the taskstats interface.  A new set of cgroup operations are
registered with commands and attributes.  It should be very easy to
*extend* per cgroup statistics, by adding members to the cgroupstats
structure.

The current model for cgroupstats is a pull, a push model (to post
statistics on interesting events), should be very easy to add.  Currently
user space requests for statistics by passing the cgroup file
descriptor.  Statistics about the state of all the tasks in the cgroup
is returned to user space.

TODO's/NOTE:

This patch provides an infrastructure for implementing cgroup statistics.
Based on the needs of each controller, we can incrementally add more statistics,
event based support for notification of statistics, accumulation of taskstats
into cgroup statistics in the future.

Sample output

# ./cgroupstats -C /cgroup/a
sleeping 2, blocked 0, running 1, stopped 0, uninterruptible 0

# ./cgroupstats -C /cgroup/
sleeping 154, blocked 0, running 0, stopped 0, uninterruptible 0

If the approach looks good, I'll enhance and post the user space utility for
the same

Feedback, comments, test results are always welcome!

uniphier/linux-unph,125c99bc8b6b108d251169a86324a7ed3c6f3cce,"scsi: add new scsi-command flag for tagged commands

Currently scsi piggy backs on the block layer to define the concept
of a tagged command.  But we want to be able to have block-level host-wide
tags assigned even for untagged commands like the initial INQUIRY, so add
a new SCSI-level flag for commands that are tagged at the scsi level, so
that even commands without that set can have tags assigned to them.  Note
that this alredy is the case for the blk-mq code path, and this just lets
the old path catch up with it.

We also set this flag based upon sdev->simple_tags instead of the block
queue flag, so that it is entirely independent of the block layer tagging,
and thus always correct even if a driver doesn't use block level tagging
yet.

Also remove the old blk_rq_tagged; it was only used by SCSI drivers, and
removing it forces them to look for the proper replacement.

uniphier/linux-unph,601cc11d054ae4b5e9b5babec3d8e4667a2cb9b5,"Make non-compat preadv/pwritev use native register size

Instead of always splitting the file offset into 32-bit 'high' and 'low'
parts, just split them into the largest natural word-size - which in C
terms is 'unsigned long'.

This allows 64-bit architectures to avoid the unnecessary 32-bit
shifting and masking for native format (while the compat interfaces will
obviously always have to do it).

This also changes the order of 'high' and 'low' to be ""low first"".  Why?
Because when we have it like this, the 64-bit system calls now don't use
the ""pos_high"" argument at all, and it makes more sense for the native
system call to simply match the user-mode prototype.

This results in a much more natural calling convention, and allows the
compiler to generate much more straightforward code.  On x86-64, we now
generate

        testq   %rcx, %rcx      # pos_l
        js      .L122   #,
        movq    %rcx, -48(%rbp) # pos_l, pos

from the C source

        loff_t pos = pos_from_hilo(pos_h, pos_l);
	...
        if (pos < 0)
                return -EINVAL;

and the 'pos_h' register isn't even touched.  It used to generate code
like

        mov     %r8d, %r8d      # pos_low, pos_low
        salq    $32, %rcx       #, tmp71
        movq    %r8, %rax       # pos_low, pos.386
        orq     %rcx, %rax      # tmp71, pos.386
        js      .L122   #,
        movq    %rax, -48(%rbp) # pos.386, pos

which isn't _that_ horrible, but it does show how the natural word size
is just a more sensible interface (same arguments will hold in the user
level glibc wrapper function, of course, so the kernel side is just half
of the equation!)

Note: in all cases the user code wrapper can again be the same. You can
just do

	#define HALF_BITS (sizeof(unsigned long)*4)
	__syscall(PWRITEV, fd, iov, count, offset, (offset >> HALF_BITS) >> HALF_BITS);

or something like that.  That way the user mode wrapper will also be
nicely passing in a zero (it won't actually have to do the shifts, the
compiler will understand what is going on) for the last argument.

And that is a good idea, even if nobody will necessarily ever care: if
we ever do move to a 128-bit lloff_t, this particular system call might
be left alone.  Of course, that will be the least of our worries if we
really ever need to care, so this may not be worth really caring about.

result was that perf function could be called when RCU is not watching as

Modify the ftrace_ops_get_func() to also check the RCU and PER_CPU ops flags

The recent rework of the cpu hotplug internals changed the usage of the per
cpu state->node field, but missed to clean it up after usage.

So subsequent hotplug operations use the stale pointer from a previous
operation and hand it into the callback functions. The callbacks then
dereference a pointer which either belongs to a different facility or
points to freed and potentially reused memory. In either case data
corruption and crashes are the obvious consequence.

Reset the node and the last pointers in the per cpu state to NULL after the
operation which set them has completed.

uniphier/linux-unph,8aec5fc1d4d881fe446addb94309efb39d4e5b23,"ARM64: dts: meson-gxl: add USB host support

This adds USB host support to the Meson GXL SoC. A dwc3 controller is
used for host-mode, while a dwc2 controller (not added in this patch
because I could not get it working) is used for device-mode only.

The dwc3 controller's internal roothub has two USB2 ports enabled but no
USB3 port. Each of the ports is supplied by a separate PHY. The USB pins
are connected to the SoC's USBHOST_A and USBOTG_B pins.
Due to the way the roothub works internally the USB PHYs are left
enabled. When the dwc3 controller is disabled the PHY is never powered on
so it does not draw any extra power. However, when the dwc3 host
controller is enabled then all PHYs also have to be enabled, otherwise
USB devices will not be detected (regardless of whether they are plugged
into an enabled port or not). This means that only the dwc3 controller
has to be enabled on boards with USB support (instead of requiring all
boards to enable the PHYs additionally with the chance of forgetting to
enable one and breaking all other ports with that as well).

This also adds the USB3 PHY which currently only does some basic
initialization. That however is required because without it high-speed
devices (like USB thumb drives) do not work on some devices (probably
because the bootloader does not configure the USB3 PHY registers).

The struct cpdma_desc_pool->used_desc field can be safely removed from
CPDMA driver (and hot patch) because used_descs counter is used just
for pool consistency check at CPDMA deinitialization and now this
check can be re-implemnted using gen_pool_size(pool->gen_pool) !=
gen_pool_avail(pool->gen_pool).
More over, this will allow to get rid of warnings in
cpdma_desc_pool_destro()-> WARN_ON(pool->used_desc) which may happen
because the used_descs is used unprotected, since CPDMA has been
switched to use genalloc, and may get wrong values on SMP.

uniphier/linux-unph,7e6c131e1568dcc2033736739a9880dce1976886,"tipc: consolidate connection-oriented message reception in one function

Handling of connection-related message reception is currently scattered
around at different places in the code. This makes it harder to verify
that things are handled correctly in all possible scenarios.
So we consolidate the existing processing of connection-oriented
message reception in a single routine.  In the process, we convert the
chain of if/else into a switch/case for improved readability.

A cast on the socket_state in the switch is needed to avoid compile
warnings on 32 bit, like ""net/tipc/socket.c:1252:2: warning: case value
‘4294967295’ not in enumerated type"".  This happens because existing
tipc code pseudo extends the default linux socket state values with:

	#define SS_LISTENING    -1      /* socket is listening */
	#define SS_READY        -2      /* socket is connectionless */

It may make sense to add these as _positive_ values to the existing
socket state enum list someday, vs. these already existing defines.

uniphier/linux-unph,564c2b210add41df9a3a5aaa365c1d97cff6110d,"perf_counter: Optimize context switch between identical inherited contexts

When monitoring a process and its descendants with a set of inherited
counters, we can often get the situation in a context switch where
both the old (outgoing) and new (incoming) process have the same set
of counters, and their values are ultimately going to be added together.
In that situation it doesn't matter which set of counters are used to
count the activity for the new process, so there is really no need to
go through the process of reading the hardware counters and updating
the old task's counters and then setting up the PMU for the new task.

This optimizes the context switch in this situation.  Instead of
scheduling out the perf_counter_context for the old task and
scheduling in the new context, we simply transfer the old context
to the new task and keep using it without interruption.  The new
context gets transferred to the old task.  This means that both
tasks still have a valid perf_counter_context, so no special case
is introduced when the old task gets scheduled in again, either on
this CPU or another CPU.

The equivalence of contexts is detected by keeping a pointer in
each cloned context pointing to the context it was cloned from.
To cope with the situation where a context is changed by adding
or removing counters after it has been cloned, we also keep a
generation number on each context which is incremented every time
a context is changed.  When a context is cloned we take a copy
of the parent's generation number, and two cloned contexts are
equivalent only if they have the same parent and the same
generation number.  In order that the parent context pointer
remains valid (and is not reused), we increment the parent
context's reference count for each context cloned from it.

Since we don't have individual fds for the counters in a cloned
context, the only thing that can make two clones of a given parent
different after they have been cloned is enabling or disabling all
counters with prctl.  To account for this, we keep a count of the
number of enabled counters in each context.  Two contexts must have
the same number of enabled counters to be considered equivalent.

Here are some measurements of the context switch time as measured with
the lat_ctx benchmark from lmbench, comparing the times obtained with
and without this patch series:

		-----Unmodified-----		With this patch series
Counters:	none	2 HW	4H+4S	none	2 HW	4H+4S

2 processes:
Average		3.44	6.45	11.24	3.12	3.39	3.60
St dev		0.04	0.04	0.13	0.05	0.17	0.19

8 processes:
Average		6.45	8.79	14.00	5.57	6.23	7.57
St dev		1.27	1.04	0.88	1.42	1.46	1.42

32 processes:
Average		5.56	8.43	13.78	5.28	5.55	7.15
St dev		0.41	0.47	0.53	0.54	0.57	0.81

The numbers are the mean and standard deviation of 20 runs of
lat_ctx.  The ""none"" columns are lat_ctx run directly without any
counters.  The ""2 HW"" columns are with lat_ctx run under perfstat,
counting cycles and instructions.  The ""4H+4S"" columns are lat_ctx run
under perfstat with 4 hardware counters and 4 software counters
(cycles, instructions, cache references, cache misses, task
clock, context switch, cpu migrations, and page faults).

uniphier/linux-unph,57ccdf449f962ab5fc8cbf26479402f13bdb8be7,"tick/nohz: Prevent stopping the tick on an offline CPU

can_stop_full_tick() has no check for offline cpus. So it allows to stop
the tick on an offline cpu from the interrupt return path, which is wrong
and subsequently makes irq_work_needs_cpu() warn about being called for an
offline cpu.

Commit f7ea0fd639c2c4 (""tick: Don't invoke tick_nohz_stop_sched_tick() if
the cpu is offline"") added prevention for can_stop_idle_tick(), but forgot
to do the same in can_stop_full_tick(). Add it.

Merging down Type4 into Type3 will just remove a useless distinction.

uniphier/linux-unph,802c7eb646848d769a07704c16f7a3bbec9e5829,"drm/i915: sanity check IER at wait_request time

We might sleep here anyway so I hope an extra uncached read is ok to
add.

In #20896 we found that vbetool clobbers the IER.  In KMS mode this is
particularly bad since we don't set the interrupt regs late (in
EnterVT), so we'd fail to get *any* interrupts at all after X started
(since some distros have scripts that call vbetool at X startup
apparently).

So this patch checks IER at wait_request time, and re-enables
interrupts if it's been clobbered.  In a proper config this check
should never be triggered.

This is really a distro issue, but having a sanity check is nice, as
long as it doesn't have a real performance hit.

flush_tlb_page() was very similar to flush_tlb_mm_range() except that
it had a couple of issues:

 - It was missing an smp_mb() in the case where
   current->active_mm != mm.  (This is a longstanding bug reported by Nadav Amit)

 - It was missing tracepoints and vm counter updates.

The only reason that I can see for keeping it at as a separate
function is that it could avoid a few branches that
flush_tlb_mm_range() needs to decide to flush just one page.  This
hardly seems worthwhile.  If we decide we want to get rid of those
branches again, a better way would be to introduce an
__flush_tlb_mm_range() helper and make both flush_tlb_page() and
flush_tlb_mm_range() use it.

uniphier/linux-unph,8a5c743e308dd2b90ad10d1faaa7a1b09173a132,"mm, memcg: use consistent gfp flags during readahead

Vladimir has noticed that we might declare memcg oom even during
readahead because read_pages only uses GFP_KERNEL (with mapping_gfp
restriction) while __do_page_cache_readahead uses
page_cache_alloc_readahead which adds __GFP_NORETRY to prevent from
OOMs.  This gfp mask discrepancy is really unfortunate and easily
fixable.  Drop page_cache_alloc_readahead() which only has one user and
outsource the gfp_mask logic into readahead_gfp_mask and propagate this
mask from __do_page_cache_readahead down to read_pages.

This alone would have only very limited impact as most filesystems are
implementing ->readpages and the common implementation mpage_readpages
does GFP_KERNEL (with mapping_gfp restriction) again.  We can tell it to
use readahead_gfp_mask instead as this function is called only during
readahead as well.  The same applies to read_cache_pages.

ext4 has its own ext4_mpage_readpages but the path which has pages !=
NULL can use the same gfp mask.  Btrfs, cifs, f2fs and orangefs are
doing a very similar pattern to mpage_readpages so the same can be
applied to them as well.

uniphier/linux-unph,8dbc450f76dc8f3b47fe117cd0cde166e1f21b64,"Merge branch 'sparc-vdso'

sparc: VDSO improvements

I started out on these changes with the goal of improving perf
annotations when the VDSO is in use.  Due to lack of inlining the
helper functions are typically hit when profiling instead of
__vdso_gettimeoday() or __vdso_vclock_gettime().

The only symbols available by default are the dyanmic symbols,
which therefore doesn't cover the helper functions.

So the perf output looks terrible, because the symbols cannot be
resolved and all show up as ""Unknown"".

The sparc VDSO code forces no inlining because of the way the
simplistic %tick register read code patching works.  So fixing that
was the first order of business.  Tricks were taken from how x86
implements alternates.  The crucial factor is that if you want to
refer to locations (for the original and patch instruction(s)) you
have to do so in a way that is resolvable at link time even for a
shared object.  So you have to do this by storing PC-relative
values, and not in executable sections.

Next, we sanitize the Makefile so that the cflags et al. make more
sense.  And LDFLAGS are applied actually to invocations of LD instead
of CC.

We also add some sanity checking, specifically in a post-link check
that makes sure we don't have any unexpected unresolved symbols in the
VDSO.  This is essential because the dynamic linker cannot resolve
symbols in the VDSO because it cannot write to it.

Finally some very minor optimizations are preformed to the
vclock_gettime.c code.  One thing which is tricky with this code on
sparc is that struct timeval and struct timespec are layed out
differently on 64-bit.  This is because, unlike other architectures,
sparc defined suseconds_t as 'int' even on 64-bit.  This is why we
have all of the ""union"" tstv_t"" business and the weird assignments
in __vdso_gettimeofday().

Performance wise we do gain some cycle shere, specifically here
are cycle counts for a user application calling gettimeofday():

	no-VDSO		VDSO-orig	VDSO-new
================================================
64-bit	853 cycles	112 cycles	125 cycles
32-bit	849 cycles	134 cycles	141 cycles

These results are with current glibc sources.

To get better we'd need to implement this in assembler, and I might
just do that at some point.

The Win64 unwinder disassembles forwards from each PC to try to
determine if this PC is in an epilogue. If so, it skips calling the EH
personality function for that frame. Typically, this means you cannot
catch an exception in the same frame that you threw it, because 'throw'
calls a noreturn runtime function.

Previously we avoided this problem with the TrapUnreachable
TargetOption, but that's a much bigger hammer than we need. All we need
is a 1 byte non-epilogue instruction right after the call.  Instead,
what we got was an unconditional branch to a shared block containing the
ud2, potentially 7 bytes instead of 1. So, this reverts r206684, which
added TrapUnreachable, and replaces it with something better.

The new code pattern matches for invoke/call followed by unreachable and
inserts an int3 into the DAG. To be 100% watertight, we would need to
insert SEH_Epilogue instructions into all basic blocks ending in a call
with no terminators or successors, but in practice this is unlikely to
come up.

Summary:
With this patch when any `FunctionDecl` of a redeclaration chain is imported
then we bring in the whole declaration chain.  This involves functions and
function template specializations.  Also friend functions are affected.  The
chain is imported as it is in the ""from"" tu, the order of the redeclarations
are kept.  I also changed the lookup logic in order to find friends, but first
making them visible in their declaration context.  We may have long
redeclaration chains if all TU contains the same prototype, but our
measurements shows no degradation in time of CTU analysis (Tmux, Xerces,
Bitcoin, Protobuf).  Also, as further work we could squash redundant
prototypes, but first ensure that functionality is working properly; then
should we optimize.

This may seem like a huge patch, sorry about that. But, most of the changes are
new tests, changes in the production code is not that much.  I also tried to
create a smaller patch which does not affect specializations, but that patch
failed to pass some of the `clang-import-test`s because there we import
function specializations. Also very importantly, we can't just change the
import of `FunctionDecl`s without changing the import of function template
specializations because they are handled as `FunctionDecl`s.

In order to always import the same copy of a linkonce function,
even when encountering it with different thresholds (a higher one then a
lower one), keep track of the summary we decided to import.
This ensures that the backend only gets a single definition to import
for each GUID, so that it doesn't need to choose one.

Move the largest threshold the GUID was considered for import into the
current module out of the ImportMap (which is part of a larger map
maintained across the whole index), and into a new map just maintained
for the current module we are computing imports for. This saves some
memory since we no longer have the thresholds maintained across the
whole index (and throughout the in-process backends when doing a normal
non-distributed ThinLTO build), at the cost of some additional
information being maintained for each invocation of ComputeImportForModule
(the selected summary pointer for each import).

There is an additional map lookup for each callee being considered for
importing, however, this was able to subsume a map lookup in the
Worklist iteration that invokes computeImportForFunction. We also are
able to avoid calling selectCallee if we already failed to import at the
same or higher threshold.

I compared the run time and peak memory for the SPEC2006 471.omnetpp
benchmark (running in-process ThinLTO backends), as well as for a large
internal benchmark with a distributed ThinLTO build (so just looking at
the thin link time/memory). Across a number of runs with and without
this change there was no significant change in the time and memory.

(I tried a few other variations of the change but they also didn't
improve time or peak memory).

Add this regulator back to the device tree, and bind it to USB1.

With the new printk format strings for flags, we can get rid of
dump_flags() in mm/debug.c.

This also fixes dump_vma() which used dump_flags() for printing vma
flags.  However dump_flags() did a page-flags specific filtering of bits
higher than NR_PAGEFLAGS in order to remove the zone id part.  For
dump_vma() this resulted in removing several VM_* flags from the
symbolic translation.

otherwise a dpms off/on will wreak massive havoc. Yes, that even

cgroup could be throttled to a limit but when all cgroups cross high
limit, queue enters a higher state and so the group should be throttled
to a higher limit. It's possible the cgroup is sleeping because of
throttle and other cgroups don't dispatch IO any more. In this case,
nobody can trigger current downgrade/upgrade logic. To fix this issue,
we could either set up a timer to wakeup the cgroup if other cgroups are
idle or make sure this cgroup doesn't sleep too long. Setting up a timer
means we must change the timer very frequently. This patch chooses the
latter. Making cgroup sleep time not too big wouldn't change cgroup
bps/iops, but could make it wakeup more frequently, which isn't a big
issue because throtl_slice * 8 is already quite big.

ASoC: Updates for v3.17

This has been a pretty exciting release in terms of the framework, we've
finally got support for multiple CODECs attached to a single DAI link
which has been something there's been interest in as long as I've been
working on ASoC.  A big thanks to Benoit and Misael for their work on
this.

Otherwise it's been a fairly standard release for development, including
more componentisation work from Lars-Peter and a good selection of both
CODEC and CPU drivers.

 - Support for multiple CODECs attached to a single DAI, enabling
   systems with for example multiple DAC/speaker drivers on a single
   link, contributed by Benoit Cousson based on work from Misael Lopez
   Cruz.
 - Support for byte controls larger than 256 bytes based on the use of
   TLVs contributed by Omair Mohammed Abdullah.
 - More componentisation work from Lars-Peter Clausen.
 - The remainder of the conversions of CODEC drivers to params_width()
 - Drivers for Cirrus Logic CS4265, Freescale i.MX ASRC blocks, Realtek
   RT286 and RT5670, Rockchip RK3xxx I2S controllers and Texas Instruments
   TAS2552.
 - Lots of updates and fixes, especially to the DaVinci, Intel,
   Freescale, Realtek, and rcar drivers.

When both ends of a PCIe Link are capable of a higher bandwidth than is
currently in use, the Link is said to be ""downtrained"".  A downtrained Link
may indicate hardware or configuration problems in the system, but it's
hard to identify such Links from userspace.

Refactor pcie_print_link_status() so it continues to always print PCIe
bandwidth information, as several NIC drivers desire.

Add a new internal __pcie_print_link_status() to emit a message only when a
device's bandwidth is constrained by the fabric and call it from the PCI
core for all devices, which identifies all downtrained Links.  It also
emits messages for a few cases that are technically not downtrained, such
as a x4 device in an open-ended x1 slot.

__tipc_nl_compat_dumpit() uses a netlink_callback on stack,
so the only way to align it with other ->dumpit() call path
is calling tipc_dump_start() and tipc_dump_done() directly
inside it. Otherwise ->dumpit() would always get NULL from
cb->args[].

But tipc_dump_start() uses sock_net(cb->skb->sk) to retrieve
net pointer, the cb->skb here doesn't set skb->sk, the net pointer
is saved in msg->net instead, so introduce a helper function
__tipc_dump_start() to pass in msg->net.

Ying pointed out cb->args[0...3] are already used by other
callbacks on this call path, so we can't use cb->args[0] any
more, use cb->args[4] instead.

Pull ""Renesas ARM Based SoC DT Updates for v4.14"" from Simon Horman:

Changes of note:

* Add pin controller support to the RZ/G1M (r8a7743) SoC and
  RZ/A1 (r7s72100) SoCs now that the driver is available in v4.13-rc1.

* Add GPIO support to the RZ/G1M (r8a7743) SoC now that the driver
  is availabe in v4.13-rc1.

* Enable MMCIF0 and Ethernet AVB support on the RZ/G1M (r8a7743) SoC and
  the iWave-RZG1M-20M Qseven SOM. This depends on newly added pin
  controller support noted above.

* Use R-Car Gen 2 fallback binding for vin nodes

  This makes binding use consistent across R-Car Gen 2 SoCs.
  It does not have any run-time effect

* Use SMP jump stub SRAM region from DT on R-Car Gen 2 SoCs

  Geert Uytterhoeven says, ""The R-Car Gen2 platform code for CPU core
  bringup needs to copy a jump stub to on-SoC SRAM.  Currently it uses a
  hardcoded address pointing to ICRAM1.""

* Add Inter Connect RAM to R-Car Gen 2 and RZ/G1 SoCs

  Geert Uytterhoeven says, ""R-Car Gen2 and RZ/G1 SoCs contain two or three
  blocks of SRAM, which can be used for several purposes.  One such purpose
  is holding a jump stub for CPU core bringup.""
* Use generic compatible string for I2C EEPROM for RZ/A1 (r7s72100) SoC
  and koelsch board.

  This is part of a tree-wide cleanup by Javier Martinez Canillas

6a32e4f9dd9219261f8856f817e6655114cfec2f made the vlan code skip marking
vlan-tagged frames for not locally configured vlans as PACKET_OTHERHOST if
there was an rx_handler, as the rx_handler could cause the frame to be received
on a different (virtual) vlan-capable interface where that vlan might be
configured.

As rx_handlers do not necessarily return RX_HANDLER_ANOTHER, this could cause
frames for unknown vlans to be delivered to the protocol stack as if they had
been received untagged.

For example, if an ipv6 router advertisement that's tagged for a locally not
configured vlan is received on an interface with macvlan interfaces attached,
macvlan's rx_handler returns RX_HANDLER_PASS after delivering the frame to the
macvlan interfaces, which caused it to be passed to the protocol stack, leading
to ipv6 addresses for the announced prefix being configured even though those
are completely unusable on the underlying interface.

The fix moves marking as PACKET_OTHERHOST after the rx_handler so the
rx_handler, if there is one, sees the frame unchanged, but afterwards,
before the frame is delivered to the protocol stack, it gets marked whether
there is an rx_handler or not.

c0d3z3r0/linux-rockchip,bc1c116974a5c3f498112a6f175d3e4a8cd5bdbc,"[PATCH] elevator switching race

There's a race between shutting down one io scheduler and firing up the
next, in which a new io could enter and cause the io scheduler to be
invoked with bad or NULL data.

To fix this, we need to maintain the queue lock for a bit longer.
Unfortunately we cannot do that, since the elevator init requires to be
run without the lock held.  This isn't easily fixable, without also
changing the mempool API.  So split the initialization into two parts,
and alloc-init operation and an attach operation.  Then we can

Baozeng Ding reported a KASAN stack out of bounds issue - it uncovered that
the TCP option parsing routines in netfilter TCP connection tracking could
read one byte out of the buffer of the TCP options.  Therefore in the patch
we check that the available data length is large enough to parse both TCP
option code and size.

high speed device, but the device backs to ""powered"" state which
its high speed termination is not enabled, the usb core calls
the PHY's disconnect notifier with ""full speed"", it will NOT

If the usb core calls disconnect notifer, the port change must happen,
so it is safe to disable high speed disconenct detector, since

on the port, and we will enable high speed disconnect detector at that

c0d3z3r0/linux-rockchip,e46c7287b1c27683a8e30ca825fb98e2b97f1099,"nbd: add a basic netlink interface

The existing ioctl interface for configuring NBD devices is a bit
cumbersome and hard to extend.  The other problem is we leave a
userspace app sitting in it's syscall until the device disconnects,
which is less than ideal.

This patch introduces a netlink interface for adding and disconnecting
nbd devices.  This has the benefits of being easily extendable without
breaking older userspace applications, and allows us to configure a nbd
device without leaving a userspace app sitting waiting for the device to
disconnect.

With this interface we also gain the ability to configure more devices
than are preallocated at insmod time.  We also have gained the ability
to not specify a particular device and be provided one for us so that
userspace doesn't need to find a free device to configure.

Introduce numa_mem_id(), based on generic percpu variable infrastructure
to track ""nearest node with memory"" for archs that support memoryless
nodes.

Define API in <linux/topology.h> when CONFIG_HAVE_MEMORYLESS_NODES
defined, else stubs.  Architectures will define HAVE_MEMORYLESS_NODES
if/when they support them.

Archs can override definitions of:

numa_mem_id() - returns node number of ""local memory"" node
set_numa_mem() - initialize [this cpus'] per cpu variable 'numa_mem'
cpu_to_mem()  - return numa_mem for specified cpu; may be used as lvalue

Generic initialization of 'numa_mem' occurs in __build_all_zonelists().
This will initialize the boot cpu at boot time, and all cpus on change of
numa_zonelist_order, or when node or memory hot-plug requires zonelist
rebuild.  Archs that support memoryless nodes will need to initialize
'numa_mem' for secondary cpus as they're brought on-line.

TTM was changed a while back to allow for pipelining of buffer moves, and
part of this was the removal of waiting for a BO to idle before calling
move(), placing the responsibility on the driver to do this if required.

That's all well and good, except, we make use of move_notify() to handle
mapping/unmapping from the GPU VMM as move() isn't called on all paths.

This commit adds a wait before unmapping from a VMM in move_notify(), to
prevent GPU page faults where a buffer is still being accessed.

Currently task_active_pid_ns is not safe to call after a task becomes a
zombie and exit_task_namespaces is called, as nsproxy becomes NULL.  By
reading the pid namespace from the pid of the task we can trivially solve
this problem at the cost of one extra memory read in what should be the
same cacheline as we read the namespace from.

When moving things around I have made task_active_pid_ns out of line
because keeping it in pid_namespace.h would require adding includes of
pid.h and sched.h that I don't think we want.

This change does make task_active_pid_ns unsafe to call during
copy_process until we attach a pid on the task_struct which seems to be a
reasonable trade off.

But the lock for the list is only held when the list is really modified.
This could lead to duplicated entries because another context could create

The check and the manipulation of the list must therefore be in the same

c0d3z3r0/linux-rockchip,734c3ce3bd4d51c932893b9f6d32b9ded31acdff,"m68k: use kernel processor defines for conditional optimizations

Older m68k-linux compilers will include pre-defined symbols that
confuse what processor it is being targeted for. For example gcc-4.1.2
will pre-define __mc68020__ even if you specify the target processor
as -m68000 on the gcc command line. Newer versions of gcc have this
corrected.

In a few places the m68k code uses defined(__mc68020__) for optimizations
that include instructions that are specific to the CPU 68020 and above.
When compiling with older compilers this will be true even when we have
selected to compile for the older 68000 processors.

Switch to using the kernel processor defines, CONFIG_M68020 and friends.

c0d3z3r0/linux-rockchip,24fc7b86dc0470616803be2f921c8cd5c459175d,"ipv6: silence log messages for locally generated multicast

This patch fixes minor annoyance during transmission of unsolicited
neighbor advertisements from userspace to multicast addresses (as
far as I can see in RFC, this is allowed and the similar functionality
for IPv4 has been in arping for a long time).

Outgoing multicast packets get reinserted into local processing as if they
are received from the network. The machine thus sees its own NA and fills
the logs with error messages. This patch removes the message if NA has been
generated locally.

c0d3z3r0/linux-rockchip,4efc76bdbf9bfd2b8624c4dd52b9d8ffed176b31,"mac80211: bracket driver tracing

Currently, driver tracing is sometimes invoked
after and sometimes before the actual driver
callback. This is fine as long as the driver
has no tracing itself, but as soon as it does
it gets confusing.

To make traces containing such information
easier to read, introduce a return tracer in
mac80211 that essentially brackets any driver
tracing, and invoke the real trace before the
driver's callback, only showing the return
value, if any, afterwards.

Since tracing records the process, there's no
problem with overlapping calls if that should
happen.

c0d3z3r0/linux-rockchip,3ccc3167b0e5d46ab3bf03e22fbdb7616ce038cd,"ext3: handle deleting corrupted indirect blocks

While freeing indirect blocks we attach a journal head to the parent
buffer head, free the blocks, then journal the parent.  If the indirect
block list is corrupted and points to the parent the journal head will be
detached when the block is cleared, causing an OOPS.

Check for that explicitly and handle it gracefully.

This patch fixes the third case (image hdb.20000057.nullderef.gz)
reported in http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10882.

Immediately above the change, in the ext3_free_data function, we call
ext3_clear_blocks to clear the indirect blocks in this parent block.  If
one of those blocks happens to actually be the parent block it will clear
b_private / BH_JBD.

I did the check at the end rather than earlier as it seemed more elegant.
I don't think there should be much practical difference, although it is
possible the FS may not be quite so badly corrupted if we did it the other
way (and didn't clear the block at all).  To be honest, I'm not convinced
there aren't other similar failure modes lurking in this code, although I
couldn't find any with a quick review.
