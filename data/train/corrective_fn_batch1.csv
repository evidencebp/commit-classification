## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

Suggest users to increase `NodeManager's` heap size if `External Shuffle Service` is enabled as
`NM` can spend a lot of time doing GC resulting in  shuffle operations being a bottleneck due to `Shuffle Read blocked time` bumped up.
Also because of GC  `NodeManager` can use an enormous amount of CPU and cluster performance will suffer.
I have seen NodeManager using 5-13G RAM and up to 2700% CPU with `spark_shuffle` service on.

## How was this patch tested?

reverse the operation. Let's just always send the persistent definition

We have observed that if our service goes down for the unhealthy threshold (which is 2 checks at 30 second intervals = 60 seconds), then the ELB will stop serving traffic to all nodes in the cluster, and will wait for the healthy threshold (currently 10 * 30 = 300 seconds) AFTER the service is restored to add back the cluster nodes, meaning it remains unreachable for an extra 300 seconds.

With the new settings, the ELB will continue to timeout dead nodes after 60 seconds, but will restore healthy nodes after 20 seconds. The minimum value for healthyThreshold is 2, and the minimum value for interval is 5 seconds. I went for 10 seconds instead of the minimum sort of arbitrarily because I was not sure how much this value may affect the scalability of clusters in EC2, as it does put some extra load on the kube-proxy.

`PrunedInMemoryFileIndex.prunePartitions` shows `pruned NaN% partitions` for the following case.

```scala

A later (yet to be written) diff will be able to pass appropriate flags down to testpilot in continuous runs and that will allow testpilot to auto-disable and file tasks for tests in the opensource builds.

facebook/watchman,43b5aea53af1acffd11ff4c70095daaf2aff004d,"adopt new thrift streaming API

Summary:
In heap profiles we observed a lot of objects associated
with the journal related to the subscription path.   Those objects
appear to be alive for the duration of the subscription session,
so it gives us good reason to move forwards with updating to the
newer thrift streaming API.

This diff introduces a new endpoint `subscribeStream` that uses
the new RSocket based subscription channel.

Both the Eden server and the watchman client are able to deal
with connections from/to old versions of the server which checks
off the box around push safety.

Once this is widely deployed we can remove `StreamingSubscriber.{cpp|h}`
from the eden code base, and can remove the `legacySubscribe` code
from the watchman code base.

For IBM PowerVM Virtual I/O network devices, we can build predictable names

PVC Protection: Wait for Pod delete

Currently, the PVC protection controller will remove its finalizer when
all Pods using a PVC reach at least a Terminating state. However,
certain volumes cannot be guaranteed to be umounted until a Pod is
deleted. Only Pods not in the current pods list can be considered
deleted, so we're removing the exception to not check Terminating Pods.

This CL relaxes the shape inference constraints on tf.squeeze.
Previously, trying to squeeze a dimension whose build-time shape
was unknown would result in the squeezed shape being completely
unknown. This causes errors on some otherwise working programs that
rely on TensorFlow's build-time shape inference.
With this change, it's assumed that, if there is an explicit squeeze_dims
argument to tf.squeeze() and the dims in question are not known at shape
inference time, the input dims will be assumed to be 1. If they are not,
an error will be thrown at runtime just as before.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

In the PR, I propose to use the `TIMESTAMP_MICROS` logical type for timestamps written to parquet files. The type matches semantically to Catalyst's `TimestampType`, and stores microseconds since epoch in UTC time zone. This will allow to avoid conversions of microseconds to nanoseconds and to Julian calendar. Also this will reduce sizes of written parquet files.

## How was this patch tested?

By existing test suites.

Closes #24425 from MaxGekk/parquet-timestamp_micros.

There was an issue with the backport compat layer in yesterday's snapshot,
causing issues on certain (mostly Atom) Intel chips on kernels older than
4.2, due to the use of xgetbv without checking cpu flags for xsave support.
This manifested itself simply at module load time. Indeed it's somewhat tricky
to support 33 different kernel versions (3.10+), plus weird distro
frankenkernels.

If OpenWRT doesn't support < 4.2, you probably don't need to apply this.
But it also can't hurt, and probably best to stay updated.

hashicorp/terraform,bac66430cb37c8057084488336d1e7fdab0860a7,"terraform: consistent variable values for booleans

Fixes #6447

This ensures that all variables of type string are consistently
converted to a string value upon running Terraform.

The place this is done is in the `Variables()` call within the
`terraform` package. This is the function responsible for loading and
merging the variables from the various sources and seems ideal for
proper conversion to consistent values for various types. We actually
already had tests to this effect.

This also adds docs that talk about the fake-ish boolean variables
Terraform currently has and about how in future versions we'll likely
support them properly, which can cause BC issues so beware.

Expanding dimensions now just uses the values specified in the subquery

This commit changes the way libraries headers are included in source files:

 - If the header is in the same directory the source belongs to, so the
 notation '#include """"' is used with the path relative to the directory
 containing the source.

 - If the header is outside the directory containing the source, then we use
 the notation '#include <>' with the path relative to libraries folder.

Some of the advantages of such approach:

 - Only one search path for libraries headers.

 - OSs like Windows may have a better lookup time.

timer support is included.

Note that ideally we would enable CONFIG_NRF_RTC_TIMER only, and

This can happen with misconfigurations, or broken installations.

On situations when Mem_Buf_Limit have been set, there are cases where
some records can be discarded by the engine because the input instance
has been block (limited by Mem_buf_Limit) and some queued events on
in_tail would like to proceed anyways.

This patch makes in_tail to check the instance status before to append
more data, if is blocked, it will try later once the collectors routines

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?
When use PeriodicGraphCheckpointer to persist graph, sometimes the edges isn't persisted. As currently only when vertices's storage level is none, graph is persisted. However there is a chance vertices's storage level is not none while edges's is none. Eg. graph created by a outerJoinVertices operation, vertices is automatically cached while edges is not. In this way, edges will not be persisted if we use PeriodicGraphCheckpointer do persist. We need separately check edges's storage level and persisted it if it's none.

## How was this patch tested?

Do not use the dbus-1.pc pkgconfig settings to determine dbus directories. Use

This approach was suggested by Simon McVittie in:
http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/systemd-devel/2014-October/024388.html

Tested by building and installing systemd without the dbus-devel installed.
Without this patch, the dbus files and directories end up in the root of the
filesystem. With this patch, they end up in the same locations as previously
(assuming default ${sysconfdir} and ${datadir}) whether dbus-devel is present

Automatic merge from submit-queue (batch tested with PRs 45040, 48960)

Do not generate warning event on dns search deduplication

In the case that the node is able to use the cluster DNS, `cluster.local` will already be in the node search domains in `/etc/resolv.conf`.  The kubelet then parses `/etc/resolv.conf` on the node and combines it with  $namespace.svc.$clusterDomain, svc.$clusterDomain, and $clusterDomain to create the pod DNS search domains.  clusterDomain is `cluster.local` by default.  This causes the code to generate a Warning event visible to the user for _every_ pod:

```
Warning   DNSSearchForming     Found and omitted duplicated dns domain in host search line: 'cluster.local' during merging with cluster dns domains
```
This is really overkill.  IMHO, this should be done in the background with no user level notification or logging at all.

When ngtsc generates a .ngfactory shim, it does so based on the contents of

comments at the top which are load-bearing (e.g. they contain jsdoc
annotations which are significant to downstream bundling tools). The
generated factory shims should preserve this comment.

This commit adds a step to the ngfactory generator to preserve the top-level

Developers from all levels will accidentally run rake tasks using the `rails` keyword when they meant to use `rake`. Often times beginners struggle with the difference between the tools. The most common example would be `$ rails db:migrate`

Rather than telling the developer simply that they did not use a valid rails command, we can see if it was a valid rake command first. If it is a valid rake command we can auto execute it giving the user a period of time to cancel if that isn't what they intended.

Here is what `rake db:migrate` would look like if you cancel the command:


```sh
$ rails db:migrate
Assuming you meant: $ rake db:migrate 
press any key to cancel in 3 seconds
> 
command terminated ...
```

Here is what it looks like if you don't cancel the command:

```sh
$ rails db:migrate
Assuming you meant: $ rake db:migrate 
press any key to cancel in 3 seconds

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

We only supported nested schema pruning for Parquet previously. This proposes to support nested schema pruning for ORC too.

Note: This only covers ORC v1. For ORC v2, the necessary change is at the schema pruning rule. We should deal with ORC v2 as a TODO item, in order to reduce review burden.

## How was this patch tested?

Added tests.

Closes #23943 from viirya/nested-schema-pruning-orc.

This commit removes the breach transaction from the
arguments passed to NewBreachRetribution. We already
keep all prior remote commitments on disk in the
commitment log, and load that transaction from disk
inside the method. In practice, the one loaded from
disk will be the same one that is passed in by the
caller, so there should be no change in behavior
as we've already derived the appropriate state number.

This changes makes integration with the watchtower
client simpler, since we no longer need to acquire
the breaching commitment transaction to be able to
construct the BreachRetribution. This simplifies
not only the logic surrounding transient backsups,
but also on startup (and later, retroactively
backing up historic updates).

While we are traversing the freelist anyways, merge a record
with the left if it is also a free list record.

That partially makes up for the fragmentation introduced by
the lack of merging with right records in tdb_free().

Note there is a potential slight downside:
If the left record we merge the current record into was earlier
in the chain and has hence already been met in traverse,
then we can not use the enlarged record even if it might be
a new best fit.

[Kubelet] Delay deletion of pod from the API server until volumes are deleted

Previous PR that was reverted: #40239.

To summarize the conclusion of the previous PR after reverting:
- The status manager has the most up-to-date status, but the volume manager uses the status from the pod manager, which only is as up-to-date as the API server.
- Because of this, the previous change required an additional round trip between the kubelet and API server.
- When few pods are being added or deleted, this is only a minor issue.  However, when under heavy load, the QPS limit to the API server causes this round trip to take ~60 seconds, which is an unacceptable increase in latency. Take a look at the graphs in #40239 to see the effect of QPS changes on timing.
- To remedy this, the volume manager looks at the status from the status manager, which eliminates the round trip.

use lowercase hostnames for node names

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

Uppercase hostnames used in charms result in (lowercase) node name lookup errors. This happens when /etc/hostname contains uppercase characters and gethostname or getfqdn return those characters.

**Special notes for your reviewer**:

Discovered in a field deployment where hostnames are all uppercase.

**Release note**:

```release-note
Hostnames are now converted to lowercase before being used for node lookups in the kubernetes-worker charm.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?
Task summary table displays the summary of the task table in the stage page. However, the 'Duration' metrics of 'task summary' table and 'task table' are not matching. The reason is because, in the 'task summary' we display 'executorRunTime' as the duration, and in the 'task table' the actual duration of the task. Except duration metrics, all other metrics are properly displaying in the task summary.

In Spark2.2, used to show 'executorRunTime' as duration in the 'taskTable'. That is why, in summary metrics also the 'exeuctorRunTime' shows as the duration. So, we need to show 'executorRunTime' as the duration in the tasks table to follow the same behaviour as the previous versions of spark.

## How was this patch tested?

Summary:
Ref T13244. See PHI1057. Currently, if you're a member of a lot of projects/packages, you can end up with a very large `commit.authorPHID IN (...)` clause in part of the ""Active Audits"" query, since your `alice` token in ""Responsible Users: alice"" expands into every package and project you can audit on behalf of.

It's impossible for a commit to be authored by anything but a user, and evidence in PHI1057 suggests this giant `IN (...)` list can prevent MySQL from making effective utilization of the `<authorPHID, auditStatus, ...>` key on the table.

Prefilter the list of PHIDs to only PHIDs which can possibly author a commit.

(We'll also eventually need to convert the `authorPHIDs` into `identityPHIDs` anyway, for T12164, and this moves us slightly toward that.)

Test Plan: Loaded ""Active Audits"" before and after change, saw a more streamlined and sensible `authorPHID IN (...)` clause afterwards.

I found that running `HiveComparisonTest.createQueryTest` to generate Hive golden answer files on Hive 0.13.1 would throw KryoException. I am not sure if this can be reproduced by others. Since Hive 0.13.0, Kryo plan serialization is introduced to replace javaXML as default plan serialization format. This is a quick fix to set hive configuration to use javaXML serialization.

Calling the D-Bus method for the OpenURI portal ""protects"" the logic from
not ever having the remote method running in case the xdg-desktop-portal

This should not be a problem as the method returns immediately (regardless
of the user making a selection), but making it synchronous would prevent
situations where the OpenURI method would never be called because of D-Bus
dropping the message after the caller dies, without explicitly waiting for
a reply.

I guess my previous pull request was confusing, by changing the message to something we already do for tasks, it makes it more clear.

Just like we say:

    TASK: [foo bar]

The message now is more clear:

    PLAY [wagawaga] *******************************

It makes it clear that we are skipping the play, just as is done for a task when a condition is not met.

michael-simons/spring-boot,69320180d9d33ad682232c11f901671ef8da05b3,"Make FileSystemWatcherTests.waitsForPollingInterval more robust

The intent of the test is to:

1. Make a change
2. Sleep for long enough for that change to be picked up
3. Make another change
4. Stop that watcher after 1 further scan has been performed
5. Assert that a further scan was performed by checking that two
   separate sets of changes (step 1 and step 3) have been picked up

Previously, step 2 relied on simply sleeping for a period of time
longer than the polling interval. In reality, the polling interval
is only a minimum time between scans and the actual time between them
depends on thread scheduling, GC pauses, etc. This lead to the
test failing intermittently if the scan didn't happen in a timely
manner.

This commit removes the sleep and replaces it with a while loop that
waits for first change to be picked up. This ensures that the second
change will be detected separately from the first and that two
separate change sets should always be available once the watcher has
stopped.

To avoid the case where the YARN libraries would swallow the exception and
prevent YarnAllocator from shutting down, call the offending code in a
separate thread, so that the parent thread can respond appropriately to
the shut down.

As a safeguard, also explicitly stop the executor launch thread pool when
shutting down the application, to prevent new executors from coming up
after the application started its shutdown.

Tested with unit tests + some internal tests on real cluster.

Closes #24017 from vanzin/SPARK-27094.

Previously, the `test_saucelabs_bazel` job was run as part of the
`saucelabs_test` workflow every hour (for every ""publish branch"";
currently 8.0.x, 8.1.x and master).

Since this job runs a subset of the tests in
`legacy-unit-tests-saucelabs` (see [BUILD.bazel][1]) and is just a
proof-of-concept for running tests on SauceLabs via bazel, there is
little point in running is on all branches. It is also wasteful to run
it every hour, even if there were no changes pushed into the branch
since the last run.

This commit makes the job part of `default_workflow`, but limits it to
only be run on master builds (not on other branches or PRs). Based on
its recent history, the job is relatively stable and (since it will only
be run on master builds) it is not expected to affect our dev workflow.

Adds an automated hook in the merge script that can close the JIRA,
set the fix versions, and leave a comment on the JIRA indicating the
PR in which it was resolved. This ensures that (a) we always close JIRA's
when issues are merged and (b) there is a link to the pull request in every JIRA.

This requires a python library called `jira-client`. We could look at embedding this
library in our project, but it seemed simple enough to just gracefully disable this
feature if it is not installed. It can be installed with `pip install jira-client`.

Looks like we can even get rid of user-provided DNS names and
use `uniqueString` to generate that consistently from resource
group and deployment name. This now produces DNS names such as
`swarm-fgd27vb3n5gn6.westus.cloudapp.azure.com` but nobody really
runs a public website like that anyway, so I think it's fine.

It also saves user from another confusing parameter that has strict
validation checks.

The implementation of `attribute_method?` on Active Record requires
establishing a database connection and querying the schema. As a general
rule, we don't want to require database connections for any class macro,
as the class should be able to be loaded without a database (e.g. for
things like compiling assets).

Instead of eagerly defining these methods, we do it lazily the first
time they are accessed via `method_missing`. This should not cause any
performance hits, as it will only hit `method_missing` once for the
entire class.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?
After rethinking on the artifactId, I think it should be `spark-avro` instead of `spark-sql-avro`, which is simpler, and consistent with the previous artifactId. I think we need to change it before Spark 2.4 release.

Also a tiny change: use `spark.sessionState.newHadoopConf()` to get the hadoop configuration, thus the related hadoop configurations in SQLConf will come into effect.

Secure kube-scheduler

This PR:
* Adds a bootstrap `system:kube-scheduler` clusterrole
* Adds a bootstrap clusterrolebinding to the `system:kube-scheduler` user
* Sets up a kubeconfig for kube-scheduler on GCE (following the controller-manager pattern)
* Switches kube-scheduler to running with kubeconfig against secured port (salt changes, beware)
* Removes superuser permissions from kube-scheduler in local-up-cluster.sh
* Adds detailed RBAC deny logging

GiulianoFranchetto/zephyr,081c9c3becc8b99f295ed015c4fc8c1f718bb515,"scripts: extract_dts_includes: Generate'_0' defines only when needed

Indexed defines were systematically generated even when there
was only one element to generate.
So we ended up generated a lot of _0 defines.
Then we needed to generate aliases to these _0 indexed defines,
in order to get useful defines.
For instance:
 #define GPIO_LEDS_0_GPIO_FLAGS_0	4
 #define GPIO_LEDS_0_GPIO_PIN_0		5
 #define GPIO_LEDS_0_GPIO_FLAGS		GPIO_LEDS_0_GPIO_FLAGS_0
 #define GPIO_LEDS_0_GPIO_PIN		GPIO_LEDS_0_GPIO_PIN_0

This commit allows to generate _0 indexed define only if a
property has more than one elements to define.
Aliases generation to _0 indexed defines are also removed.

Note: IRQ are left untouched since this is frequent to handle
multiple IRQs in a driver

Fill controller caches on startup

The controller needs to fill its caches before it starts binding/recycling/ deleting or provisioning volumes and claims. This was done using blocking initial 'xxx added' from going through syncClaim/syncVolume. However, when the caches were full, the controller waited for the next sync period to do actual binding/recycling etc.

In this patch, the controller fills its caches directly from etcd and then processes initial 'xxx added' events to reconcile the world and bind/recycle/ delete/provision stuff, resulting in faster binding after startup.

This commit changes the way libraries headers are included in source files:

 - If the header is in the same directory the source belongs to, so the
 notation '#include """"' is used with the path relative to the directory
 containing the source.

 - If the header is outside the directory containing the source, then we use
 the notation '#include <>' with the path relative to libraries folder.

Some of the advantages of such approach:

 - Only one search path for libraries headers.

 - OSs like Windows may have a better lookup time.

[Federation] Remove FEDERATIONS_DOMAIN_MAP references

Remove all references to FEDERATIONS_DOMAIN_MAP as this method is no longer is used and is replaced by adding federation domain map to kube-dns configmap.

cc @madhusudancs @kubernetes/sig-federation-pr-reviews 

**Release note**:
```
[Federation] Mechanism of adding `federation domain maps` to kube-dns deployment via `--federations` flag is superseded by adding/updating `federations` key in `kube-system/kube-dns` configmap. If user is using kubefed tool to join cluster federation, adding federation domain maps to kube-dns is already taken care by `kubefed join` and does not need further action.

Don't check for a negative parameter count, because not only will it
never happen, it doesn't make any sense either.

Invalid sockets (as returned by socket(2)) are always exactly -1 (not
just negative as negative file descriptors are technically not
prohibited by POSIX) on POSIX systems.  Since we store them in SOCKET
(unsigned int), however, that really is ~0U (or MAX_UINT) which happens
to be what INVALID_SOCKET is already defined to, so an additional check
for being negative is not only unnecessary (unsigned integers aren't
*ever* negative) its redundant as well (the INVALID_SOCKET comparison is
enough).

Automatic merge from submit-queue (batch tested with PRs 46635, 45619, 46637, 45059, 46415)

Certificate rotation for kubelet server certs.

Replaces the current kubelet server side self signed certs with certs signed by
the Certificate Request Signing API on the API server. Also renews expiring
kubelet server certs as expiration approaches.

Two Points:
1. With `--feature-gates=RotateKubeletServerCertificate=true` set, the kubelet will
    request a certificate during the boot cycle and pause waiting for the request to
    be satisfied.
2. In order to have the kubelet's certificate signing request auto approved,
    `--insecure-experimental-approve-all-kubelet-csrs-for-group=` must be set on
    the cluster controller manager. There is an improved mechanism for auto
    approval [proposed](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/45030).

**Release note**:
```release-note
With `--feature-gates=RotateKubeletServerCertificate=true` set, the kubelet will
request a server certificate from the API server during the boot cycle and pause
waiting for the request to be satisfied. It will continually refresh the certificate as
the certificates expiration approaches.

drivers, especially when dealing with code paths for prepared statements
(which we are). While this should only affect SQLite, as I'm not aware
of any drivers which don't support multi-insert. Even if this does
affect other third party drivers though, I'd prefer not to assume that
more than one query can be executed per call to `execute`.

Fixes #26948.
Close #27242.

Here's the initial version of the scheduling policy admission controller. It's at the point where it would benefit from having another pair of eyes look at it. The main thing I'm unsure of is the serialization of Kube resources for the webhook/query call.

switch rbac to external

The overall trajectory of the project is towards external types.  Having all helpers agree on the version they operate on makes life much easier.  We've already written one RBAC controller (role aggregation) and more may follow.  `v1` has been around for a while now and we know that any future changes have to reliably roundtrip through it.  This pull switches all the core helpers over to use the external types.

This is the first in a series of changes to make SILGen always emit switch_enums
such that payloads are always passed as an arguments to the destination blocks.
This is important since switch_enum today in SILGen is modeled as a consuming
operation. Thus if we follow the model today where we reuse in the destination
blocks the switched upon value, we have created either a use after free or a
double consuming (depending on how the value is used).

There is no reason why we should use a default case here for these optional enums.

This is a multipoller based on epoll rather than poll.

Note that this implementation is aimed at correctness rather than
performance, although it should immediately have better scalability to
large numbers of FDs, both due to epoll's O(1) sized API and due to not
needing to wake up polling threads to do interest set changes.

One notable difference here is that we directly attach a wakeup fd
rather than using the freelisting kick mechanism that the poll() based
implementations use, because modifying the epoll set to use a different
kick fd each time isn't free.

It was discovered that compression in gelf logging driver
is highly inefficient in terms of CPU. IOW, lots of CPU
is used when compression is enabled.

The natural solution would be to change the default
to `none`, i.e. no compression, but that would break
some setups (in particular, using Logstash < 7.4).

The only option left is to warn the user about the
consequences of leaving the compression enabled.

With transactional fixtures enabled, the session records would end up in
@_current_transaction_records, and at the end of the transaction,
methods would be called on them that would trigger method_missing and
trigger attribute methods to be generated.

However, at this point the sessions table would not exist, and the
columns were not cached, so an exception would be raised because we
can't find the columns to generate attribute methods for.

Not sure exactly why this didn't crop up before but there have been
changes to the schema cache code and perhaps that means that column data
that was cached previously at that point is now uncached.

should hence explicitly filter them out by looking at the string

yujuhong/kubernetes,97689c326da2a9170e25ed5e1bdb8f3e2bc50533,"Reduce healthy threshold and check interval for Amazon ELBs

According to AWS, the ELB healthy threshold is ""Number of consecutive health check successes before declaring an EC2 instance healthy."" It has an unusual interaction with Kubernetes, since all nodes will enter either an unhealthy state or a healthy state together depending on the service's healthiness as a whole.

We have observed that if our service goes down for the unhealthy threshold (which is 2 checks at 30 second intervals = 60 seconds), then the ELB will stop serving traffic to all nodes in the cluster, and will wait for the healthy threshold (currently 10 * 30 = 300 seconds) AFTER the service is restored to add back the cluster nodes, meaning it remains unreachable for an extra 300 seconds.

With the new settings, the ELB will continue to timeout dead nodes after 60 seconds, but will restore healthy nodes after 20 seconds. The minimum value for healthyThreshold is 2, and the minimum value for interval is 5 seconds. I went for 10 seconds instead of the minimum sort of arbitrarily because I was not sure how much this value may affect the scalability of clusters in EC2, as it does put some extra load on the kube-proxy.

When testing whether `value` is an object, use the ideal sequence of
strictly not equal to `null` followed by `typeof value === 'object'`
consistently. Specifically there's no point in using double equal with
`null` since `undefined` is ruled out by the `typeof` check.

Also avoid the unnecessary ToBoolean check on `value.ngOnDestroy` in
`hasOnDestroy()`, since the `typeof value.ngOnDestroy === 'function'`
will only let closures pass and all closures are truish (with the
notable exception of `document.all`, but that shouldn't be relevant
for the `ngOnDestroy` hook).

6d2f277 rpcuser.py: Use 'python' not 'python2' (Henrik Jonsson)

Pull request description:

  Note that `rpcuser.py` seems to handle either version when called explicitly like `python2 rpcuser.py` / `python3 rpcuser.py`. This change allows the user's `python` to be used to interpret the script.

  There's not always a `python2` installed, e.g. if only Python 3.0+ is installed as `python` / `python3`, like on Arch Linux (https://github.com/hkjn/src/blob/master/bitcoin/Dockerfile#L14) but `python` is almost always present.

  # Tested

  Script is already compatible with both major versions:
  ```
  $ python2 share/rpcuser/rpcuser.py foobar
  String to be appended to bitcoin.conf:
  rpcauth=foobar:2951d04c215769c8887c1fa4a8f712c$63c9a08e3b69f811e3837c0d5b6a355b7f798afc7094d80008f5c56a056c387f

In the current implementation of named expressions' `ExprIds`, we rely on a per-JVM AtomicLong to ensure that expression ids are unique within a JVM. However, these expression ids will not be _globally_ unique. This opens the potential for id collisions if new expression ids happen to be created inside of tasks rather than on the driver.

There are currently a few cases where tasks allocate expression ids, which happen to be safe because those expressions are never compared to expressions created on the driver. In order to guard against the introduction of invalid comparisons between driver-created and executor-created expression ids, this patch extends `ExprId` to incorporate a UUID to identify the JVM that created the id, which prevents collisions.

When an `around_action` does not `yield`, then the corresponding action is
*never* executed and the `after_` actions are *never* invoked.

The value returned by the `around_action` does not have any impact on this:
an `around_action` can ""return"" `true`, `false`, or `""pizza""`, but as long
as `yield` is not invoked, the corresponding action and after callbacks are
not executed.

The test suite for `ActionController::Callbacks` currently includes separate
tests to distinguish the cases in which a non-yielding `around_actions` returns
`true` or `false`.

In my opinion, having such tests is misleading, giving the impression that the
returned value might have some sort of impact, while it does not. At least
that's the impression I got when I read those tests.

This code was added before the accurate pv patch, when
we retrieved PV directly from TT.

It's not required for correct (and long) PVs any more and
should be safe to remove it.

Also, allowing helper threads to repeatedly over-write
TT doesn't seem to make sense(that was probably an un-intended
side-effect of lazy smp). Before Lazy SMP only Main Thread used
to run ID loop and insert PV into TT.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

SHS is using a relative path for the REST API call to get the list of the application is a relative path call. In case of the SHS being consumed through a proxy, it can be an issue if the path doesn't end with a ""/"".

Therefore, we should use an absolute path for the REST call as it is done for all the other resources.

Automatic merge from submit-queue

pkg/apiserver/authenticator: reorder oidc plugin to auth after service accounts

Both plugins verify JWTs, but the OpenID Connect plugin performs
much worse when faced with cache misses. Reorder the plugins so
the service account plugin tries to authenticate a bearer token
first.

I had a fun time with this by writing an OpenID Connect provider that stores its data in third party resources. When it's running in the cluster it uses a service account and caused some interesting behavior when the keys expired.

Our OpenID Connect plugin needs a more sophisticated caching model to avoid continuously re-requesting keys when seeing a lot of tokens it doesn't recognize. However, I feel this reordering is generally useful since service accounts will be more common than OpenID Connect tokens.

The reset_ntl procedure is called by the device driver to bring the DL out

lane and clock power up to the reset_ntl procedure.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

`CatalogStorageFormat.properties` can be used in 2 ways:

1. for hive tables, it stores the serde properties.
2. for data source tables, it stores the data source options, e.g. `path`, `skipHiveMetadata`, etc.

however, both of them have nothing to do with data source properties, e.g. `spark.sql.sources.provider`, so they should not have limitations about data source properties.

## How was this patch tested?

3d4fa83587 Stop translating command line options (Wladimir J. van der Laan)

Pull request description:

  Many options are extremely technical, and refer internals, making it difficult to translate usefully. This came up in discussion of e.g.  #10949. If a message is not understood by translators (which are typically end-users, not developers) they'll either translate it literally, making it harder to understand instead of easier, with the added drawback of the user no longer being able to google it.

  Also the translation was only working for bitcoin-qt as with the console programs, there is no translation backend. So it was injecting never-used translation messages for bitcoin-cli, -tx.

  For these reasons, stop translating options help completely. This should not affect the output **in any way** \* except for bitcoin-qt when a non-English language is configured in the locale.

  This implements #10962.

  \*) I checked this, but please do verify this.

When we complete a Prepare, we queue a Commit or Abort item into the
CheckpointManager.
At persistence of Commit/Abort, we don't know what is the Prepare

While that information has never been necessary so far, now it is for
persisting the High Completed Seqno to disk.

This patch ensures that both the Commit and Abort queued items in CM
carry the seqno of the associated Prepare (ie, the prepared-seqno).

In follow-up patches, the prepared-seqno will be used at persistence for
computing the HCS and writing it to disk.

The i2s_cavs.c driver manipulates cache lines before commencing
any DMA transfers. With write-back cache, if the DMA receive
buffer is not aligned to the cache lines, the data around
the buffer will be invalidated and may never written to memory.
Since the driver takes an external memory slab as buffer and
there is no easy way to force cache line alignment on
the application side, set the cached region to write-through
to avoid potential issue.

The result is that the user can now have a (customised) ``_config.yml``

``docs`` directory to use as the ``source``.  Previously, in order to
customise it, the original ``_config.yml`` needed to be modified inside

the root of the Bootstrap package as the original file path to
``configBridge.json`` was only valid there.

inefficient and could display longer cycles than are actually
present. Additionally, the diagnostic is not specialized to the actual

show all of the declarations involved in the cycle, which at least
lets the user figure out where the cycle occurred.

There has been a lot of confusion about what the CPU clock override

doesn’t directly state which CPU clock rate is being overridden!

This small change adjusts the language to clarify that the emulated CPU

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

When we parse DDLs involving table or database properties, we need to validate the values.
E.g. if we alter a database's property without providing a value:
```
ALTER DATABASE my_db SET DBPROPERTIES('some_key')
```
Then we'll ignore it with Hive, but override the property with the in-memory catalog. Inconsistencies like these arise because we don't validate the property values.

In such cases, we should throw exceptions instead.

PEP 3106 [1] changed the behavior of the dictionaries `items` method.
In Python 2, `items` builds a real list of tuples where `iteritems`
returns a generator. PEP 3106 changes Python 3's `items` method to be
equivalent to Python 2's `iteritems` and completely removes `iteritems`
in Python 3.

This patch switches to both to use `items`. This could have a negative
impact on Python 2's performance because it now causes the dictionary
tuples to be built in memory.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

We should reuse an object similar to the other non-primitive type getters. For
a query that computes averages over decimal columns, this shows a 10% speedup
on overall query times.

By default a given project's label applicable scope is all changes
on all branches of this project and its child projects.

Label's applicable scope can be branch specific via configuration.
E.g. create a label 'Video-Qualify' on parent project and configure
the 'branch' as:

[label ""Video-Qualify""]
    branch = refs/heads/video-1.0/*
    branch = refs/heads/video-1.1/Kino

Then ONLY changes in above branch scope of parent project and child
projects will be affected by 'Video-Qualify'.

Please note the 'branch' is independent from the branch scope related
to access control defined in 'access' parts in 'project.config' file.
That means from the UI a user can always assign permissions for that
label on a branch, but this permission is then ignored if the label
doesn't apply for that branch.

About The Pull Request
Buffs C2 Healing

I should have leaned to more healing initially, especially since they're damaging. Goal here is to make them more enticing.
Dilutes Starting Meds / Borg Hydro Microdosing

Perhaps this was the biggest issue in that your DEFAULTS carried way too much of the chem specifically designed for lower dosages so people were getting smacked with needless damage consistently.

You can still make your own ""pure"" samples I guess, but I think you'll like the current values.

Borgs can now switch between 5u/2u with altclick.
Adds a C3 Diluent Specifically for Minor Brute/Burn

Wouldn't make much sense to dilute it with air! Granibitaluri is a new C3 that slowly tops off your damage by order of brute then burn. The catch is you must be at 10 damage or less for the healing to apply. ODs at 50.

This is the reagent all C2s are diluted with regardless of what they heal (meaning brute/burn chems will heal a tad better but only when you're about healed anyways).
Why It's Good For The Game

Buffed C2s to make them more viable as contenders to some of the more oddity avenues you guys were using.

Dilutes C2s to make the roundstart items viable on their own without chemistry (or at least a chem master). Same with Borg Microdosing option.

Added the C3 since it was suggested by zxaber to have a form of healing more minor damage without going through the lengths of surgery.

Sorry in advance silicon players, the solutions are still pure in your hypo!
Changelog

cl Anarcho-Capitalistabital-by
add: In General, Buffs healing thoroughput of C2s. You can stop paying your cloners overtime now!
tweak: The roundstart C2 methods are now diluted with a new reagent, Granibitaluri.
tweak: The borghypo now can switch to ""microdosing"", which is 2u transfer via AltClick
add: Granibitaluri is a C3 (no downside!!!) that tops off your brute THEN burn damage if they are at or below 10 damage.
/cl

jdubois/homebrew-core,37ce40b8d1de1e20e890c7cdba11bf21150eeb44,"ceylon: .bat file is needed for Ceylon Bootstrap.

Before we would delete any Windows batch files because we didn't need
them for the Mac (of course). But since 1.2.2 we have a `ceylon
bootstrap` command which works like `gradle wrapper` in providing a
very simple way for people to distribute Ceylon projects to people who
don't have Ceylon installed. It generates two scripts, `ceylonb` for
the unices and `ceylonb.bat` for Windows. Users on any OS can run these
scripts and they will automatically install Ceylon if necessary. So
even if the file will never be used on a Mac it needs to be available
so the `ceylon bootstrap` command can *copy* it (it will never be
executed of course for obvious reasons).

Closes Homebrew/homebrew#50045.

habitat-sh/habitat,cd08b1e1f1c49a16036ed16d09912a337f786a7c,"Remove all embedded color codes

In several places we were directly embedding ANSI color codes in a log
message as a way to emphasize certain parts of that message. However,
this bypasses the existing controls we have over whether or not to
colorize the Supervisor's output; regardless of your settings, these
emphasized parts would *always* be colored.

As an initial step to bring colored output under control, we are
simply removing all these embedded ""emphasis colors"". A possible
long-term solution would be to introduce a minimal templating language
of sorts that allows us to mark particular bits of text for emphasis
of one kind or another, allowing the final formatting of a message to
be handled centrally. Think of an HTML/CSS-style separation of
concerns, but for fancy colored log output.

Summary:
Because these shell steps now take relative paths,
they can be resolved to absolute paths appropriately in
`getShellCommandInternal(ExecutionContext)` by
`ExecutionContext.getProjectFilesystem().getPathRelativizer().apply()`.
If we end up running `ShellStep`s on remote machines in the
future, this will make it easier to serialize a `ShellStep` and run it
on the foreign machine.
This also helps with integration tests that are run in [foreign] temp directories.

The current gossip component assumes the upper layers are able to fetch
each remote peer's certificate by its corresponding PKI-ID.
This is true for 0.5 but this isn't the case for v1,
so this commit makes each peer send the other peer its certificate
and each peer creates a mapping between PKIid-->certificate.

The gossip layer now disseminates certificates of peers in the following ways:
1) During the handshake with a remote peer
2) At initialization time, there is a configurable period in which
   the cert is appended to the AliveMessage
3) Peers can now exchange with remote peers certificates by
   comparing the pkiIDs of the certificates. This works with
   the standard built-in pull mechanism.

This commit also moves the comm layer into the gossip, instead
of what was before- where the gossip was given an instance of
the comm.

Since all EFI-based systems support GPT, this commit changes
pc_x86_64_efi to use a GPT partition table. It shows an example of how
to craft a disk image with GPT partitioning instead of MBR. This is
achieved by means of a post-image script which uses
mkdosfs+mcopy+sfdisk, since genimage is unable to deal with GPT. Long
term, it would be ideal if genimage had GPT support, but until then,
this script shows how to achieve creating a GPT-based disk image.

The script was kept as simple as possible to make it easy to understand
and adapt for other purposes.

The root filesystem location is passed to the kernel by a partition
UUID, so it is possible to boot on QEMU, directly from the disk image,
or dump the image to a physical device.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

This patch speeds up group-by aggregates by around 3-5x by leveraging an in-memory `AggregateHashMap` (please see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12161), an append-only aggregate hash map that can act as a 'cache' for extremely fast key-value lookups while evaluating aggregates (and fall back to the `BytesToBytesMap` if a given key isn't found).

Architecturally, it is backed by a power-of-2-sized array for index lookups and a columnar batch that stores the key-value pairs. The index lookups in the array rely on linear probing (with a small number of maximum tries) and use an inexpensive hash function which makes it really efficient for a majority of lookups. However, using linear probing and an inexpensive hash function also makes it less robust as compared to the `BytesToBytesMap` (especially for a large number of keys or even for certain distribution of keys) and requires us to fall back on the latter for correctness.

KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID ioctl is called frequently when initializing
CPU. Depends on CPU features and CPU count, the number of calls can be
extremely high which slows down QEMU booting significantly. In our
testing, we saw 5922 calls with switches:

    -cpu SandyBridge -smp 6,sockets=6,cores=1,threads=1

This ioctl takes more than 100ms, which is almost half of the total
QEMU startup time.

While for most cases the data returned from two different invocations
are not changed, that means, we can cache the data to avoid trapping
into kernel for the second time. To make sure the cache safe one
assumption is desirable: the ioctl is stateless. This is not true for
CPUID leaves in general (such as CPUID leaf 0xD, whose value depends
on guest XCR0 and IA32_XSS) but it is true of KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID,
which runs before there is a value for XCR0 and IA32_XSS.

Pull request description:

  Expounds on two things I've seen confuse inexperienced users:

  - transactions/outputs in `gettxoutsetinfo`: a user thought this was the total number of transactions or outputs ever seen on the chain, whereas it's only the number in the UTXO.

  - bestblock in `gettxout`: a user thought this was the block that included the output, not realizing it was the tip of the current best block chain.  I also copied this text to `gettxoutsetinfo` for congruency.  I skimmed other uses of ""bestblock"" in the RPC docs and they seemed clear to me.

remove the leading ""interval"" in `CalendarInterval.toString`.

### Why are the changes needed?

Although it's allowed to have ""interval"" prefix when casting string to int, it's not recommended.

This is also consistent with pgsql:
```

### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?

yes, when display a dataframe with interval type column, the result is different.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

In `SparkHadoopUtil. checkAccessPermission`,  we consider only basic permissions in order to check wether a user can access a file or not. This is not a complete check, as it ignores ACLs and other policies a file system may apply in its internal. So this can result in returning wrongly that a user cannot access a file (despite he actually can).

The PR proposes to delegate to the filesystem the check whether a file is accessible or not, in order to return the right result. A caching layer is added for performance reasons.

This will update camera's view center as the camera moves around.
Before the view center would be always at the zero elevation, which
means that with terrain further away from zero elevation tilting
and rotation of camera would feel weird due to the center point being
far away.

In order to update camera's view center we need to calculate intersection
of terrain with a 3D ray coming from the camera's position towards the center
of the viewport. This is done by going through the active terrain tiles
and checking whether their bounding box intersects the ray - if it does,
then we do an exact test of terrain tile's triangle mesh against the ray
to find the closest intersection point. When we have the intersection,
we update the view center to be at the terrain's surface.

Unfortunately raycasting in Qt3D is only available from 5.11 which has been
released only very recently. I have therefore ported some code from Qt3D
internals and added ray vs axis-aligned box from a different source
(Qt3D uses bounding spheres but they are not available in public API either)

This change introduces translatable URI segments and
general support for content dimensions in the frontend node
route part handler. Editors may change the path segment of
a specific document node (for example a page) in the inspector.

The route part handler which renders and matches the URIs
does not use a node's name anymore but refers to a new
node property ""uriPathSegment"". This finally decouples
URI generation from the internal node structure and naming.

This change also makes sure that router caches are flushed if
any node is updated, removed, published or discarded. That
is refined in a separate change.

In order to migrate existing websites, you must run the ""node:repair""
command in order to fill the new uriPathSegment properties.

If you used the ""LocalizedRoutePartHandler"" from a development
version of Neos, you need to remove the respective Objects.yaml
configuration.

Change Capacity log verbosity in status update

*What this PR does / why we need it:*

While in production we noticed that the log verbosity for the Capacity field in the node status was to high.
This log message is called for every device plugin resource at every update.

A proposed solution is to tune it down from V(2) to V(5). In a normal setting you'll be able to see the effect by looking at the node status.

```
NONE

Therefore, don't flag what appear to be trivial accessor defs if they are

Detection of whether a def is inside a module or not is also slightly more

This ensures coverage (we previously had unit tests, but that didn't work as people aggregated more powers in) and it makes each role smaller since it only has a diff to consider.

Automatic merge from submit-queue

Change the name of the secret that delivers federation kubeconfig.

```release-note
Federation API server kubeconfig secret consumed by federation-controller-manager has a new name.

If you are upgrading your Cluster Federation components from v1.3.x, please run this command to migrate the federation-apiserver-secret to federation-apiserver-kubeconfig serect;

$ kubectl --namespace=federation get secret federation-apiserver-secret -o json | sed 's/federation-apiserver-secret/federation-apiserver-kubeconfig/g' | kubectl create -f -

You might also want to delete the old secret using this command:

$ kubectl delete secret --namespace=federation federation-apiserver-secret
```

The current name, federation-apiserver-secret, is very similar to the
other secret we have, federation-apiserver-secrets, that delivers
somewhat similar data but in a different format. This is extremely
confusing, particularly while debugging.

This change should soothe the pain.

Add metadata for Nori

Nori is a free and open-source Android client for online tag-based image archives. https://github.com/tjg1/nori

I am the project owner of Nori and there is already an older version of Nori that was made available on F-Droid by someone else as `pe.moe.nori`.

That version is old, buggy and the package name of the app has since changed (it was pulled from Google Play and I intend to re-upload it under a new applicationId). This is the reason I'm uploading it as a new metadata file. (`io.github.tjg1.nori.txt`)

We had a discussion on IRC as to what could be done with the old metadata file (`pe.moe.nori.txt`). Since a new appId needs a new file, I'd prefer that the old file is moved to an archive repository. Alternatively, this version of the app could be named ""Nori 2"" and the old version would be kept with a note in its description saying that it's outdated, pointing to the new version of the app. I will leave this decision up to you. I have included a `Provides:pe.moe.nori` line in the new metadata file.

In the future, I will have to make some changes to Nori to make sure that it falls in line with the Google Play Store Developer Content Policy (or rather, is able to pass their automated checks).  Rest assured that the `master` branch will retain full functionality and that Nori doesn't come with any explicit image sources preconfigured, so it's completely appropriate for inclusion on F-Droid.

If you would like to confirm my ownership of the project, the commit in this merge request is signed with the same GPG key as recents commits to Nori in its GitHub repository.

[Strago: mark GpioInt() resources as PullDefault]

coreboot considers GPIO resources first-class citizens and initializes
all pads according to their intended use, with necessary pull settings
applied. Therefore let's use PullDefault as pull qualifier in AML,
letting the kernel know that it should not attempt to alter pull settings
when using GPIOs.

it's the same size as in ubuntu 14.04 and all systemd systems

Seeding /dev/urandom doesn't change entropy estimation, so we still have
""random: ubus urandom read with 4 bits of entropy available""
messages in the logs, but we can now ignore them if
after ""urandom-seed: Seeding with ..."" message

Saving a new seed on each boot is disabled by default to avoid too much
writes without user consent

v2: log preinit messages to /dev/kmsg
v3: use non generic function name for logging, as /lib/preinit/ files
    are all sourced together in /etc/preinit
v4: after a lot of discussion on the ML, use a uci config param
v5: config param is now the path of the seed

gregomni/swift,b80c96a2e7b0222044f52f3f338e18af0f6a6dd9,"[+0 self] Teach SILGen how to avoid emitting extra rr pairs when emitting RValues with Nominal Types and Tuples.

Specifically this patch makes the following changes:

1. We properly propagate down the SGFContext of a tuple to its elements
when extracting from a tuple. There was a typo that caused us to use
data from the newly created default initialized copy instead of from the
actual SGFContext of the parent tuple.

2. If we are accessing a member ref of self in a guaranteed context:

  a. If self is a struct, regardless of whether or not the field is a
     var or a let we no longer emit a retain. This is b/c self in a
     guaranteed context is immutable. This implies even a var in the
     struct can not be reassigned to.

  b. If self is a class, if the field is a let, we no longer emit an
     extra retain.

This makes it so that the only rr traffic in IntTreeNode::find is in the
block of code where we return self.

class IntTreeNode {
 let value : Int
 let left, right : IntTreeNode

 init() {} // not needed for -emit-silgen

 func find(v : Int) -> IntTreeNode {
   if v == value { return self }
   if v < value { return left.find(v) }
   return right.find(v)
 }
}

One gets the same effect using a struct for IntTreeNode and a generic
box class, i.e.:

class Box<T> {
  let value: T
  init(newValue: T) { value = newValue }
}

class Kraken {}
struct IntTreeNode {
  let k : Kraken // Just to make IntTreeNode non-trivial for rr purposes.
  let left, right : Box<IntTreeNode>

  init() {} // not needed for -emit-silgen

  func find(v : Int) -> IntTreeNode {
    if v == value { return self }
    if v < value { return left.value.find(v) }
    return right.value.find(v)
  }
}

There is more work that can be done here by applying similar logic to
enums, i.e. switching on self in an enum should not generate any rr
traffic over the switch. Also it seems that there are some places in SILGen
where isGuaranteedValid is not being propagated to SILGenFunction::emitLoad. But
that is for another day.

I am going to gather data over night and send an email to the list.

Automatic merge from submit-queue

Update Google API dependencies

We add the necessary Makefile, hotplug, config, and init bits
so that p910nd daemon runs as user:group p910nd:lp by default.
This eliminates an unnecessary root daemon.

The hotplug script sets the permissions of the USB lp
device(s) to read-write owner and group and no access to
anyone else, and sets owner root, group lp.

This is allows sufficient privileges to p910nd
to do it's job.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

It's a huge waste to call `Catalog.listTables` in `SQLContext.tableNames`, which only need the table names, while `Catalog.listTables` will get the table metadata for each table name.

## How was this patch tested?

A declarative API for specifying dependencies that affect template

When the block is evaluated, the resulting value is included in the

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?
The FileCatalog object gets created even if the user specifies schema, which means files in the directory is enumerated even thought its not necessary. For large directories this is very slow. User would want to specify schema in such scenarios of large dirs, and this defeats the purpose quite a bit.

## How was this patch tested?
Hard to test this with unit test.

AWS: More ELB attributes via service annotations

Replaces #25015 and addresses all of @justinsb's feedback therein. This is a new PR because I was unable to reopen #25015 to amend it.

I noticed recently that there is existing (but undocumented) precedent for the AWS cloud provider to manage ELB-specifc load balancer configuration based on service annotations.  In particular, one can _already_ designate an ELB as ""internal"" or enable PROXY protocol.

This PR extends this capability to the management of ELB attributes, which includes the following items:
* Access logs:
    * Enabled / disabled
    * Emit interval
    * S3 bucket name
    * S3 bucket prefix
* Connection draining:
    * Enabled / disabled
    * Timeout
* Connection:
    * Idle timeout
* Cross-zone load balancing:
    * Enabled / disabled

Some of these are possibly more useful than others.  Use cases that immediately come to mind:

* Enabling cross-zone load balancing is potentially useful for ""Ubernetes Light,"" or anyone otherwise attempting to spread worker nodes around multiple AZs.
* Increasing idle timeout is useful for the benefit of anyone dealing with long-running requests. An example I personally care about would be git pushes to Deis' builder component.",,,,,,

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

Migrate ConsoleSink to data source V2 api.

Note that this includes a missing piece in DataStreamWriter required to specify a data source V2 writer.

Note also that I've removed the ""Rerun batch"" part of the sink, because as far as I can tell this would never have actually happened. A MicroBatchExecution object will only commit each batch once for its lifetime, and a new MicroBatchExecution object would have a new ConsoleSink object which doesn't know it's retrying a batch. So I think this represents an anti-feature rather than a weakness in the V2 API.

Opting for a trigger rather than an addition to our release-tools

- The Dockerfiles in the CNG image repo change infrequently, and as a result
I don't feel the need/overhead for stable branches in that repo at this time
- My intent with the CNG repo, is that once stable, the Dockerfiles
would actualy move to their component projects, to be versioned with the

- It is likely that we will want to followup with a manually triggered package

The VFP fixed point conversion helpers first call float_scalbn and
then convert the result to an integer. This scalbn operation may
set floating point exception flags for:
 * overflow & inexact (if it overflows to infinity)
 * input denormal squashed to zero
 * output denormal squashed to zero
Of these, we only care about the input-denormal flag, since
the output of the whole scale-and-convert operation will be
an integer (so squashed-output-denormal and overflow don't
apply). Suppress the others by saving the pre-scalb exception
flags and only copying across a potential input-denormal flag.

Another fix for #28780 based on discussions at #28789

- In PostgreSQL 10 each sequence does not know its `min_value`.
A new system catalog `pg_sequence` shows it as `seqmin`.
Refer https://github.com/postgres/postgres/commit/1753b1b027035029c2a2a1649065762fafbf63f3

- `setval` 3rd argument needs to set to `false` only when the table has no rows
to avoid `nextval(<sequence_name>)` returns `2` where `1` is expected.

- `min_value` is only necessary when the table has no rows. It used to be necessary
since the 3rd argument of `setval` is always `false`.

Increase GC wait timeout in a flaky e2e test. The test expects a GC
operation to be performed within 30s, while in practice the operation
often takes longer due to a delay between the enqueueing of the owner's
delete operation and the GC's actual processing of that event. Doubling
the time seems to stabilize the test. The test's assumptions can be
revisited, and the processing delay under load can be investigated in
the future.

Support whitespace in command path for gcp auth plugin

```
External command option on gcp client auth plugin supports whitespace in command path.
```

Splitting on whitespace to get cmd+args breaks when the path the executable contains spaces. Resolve by adding a new ""cmd-args"" field to config to allow the full string of ""cmd-path"" to be interpreted as path to executable.

Preserve router metrics across restarts

Router metrics aren't preserved across HAProxy reloads.

Variant has two purposes. First to determine which version of the
question the student will see. Hence it is used to set up the state
of the quetsion when the question is started. Then the internal state of
the question is saved in the first step.

Once that has been done, the variant number is purely informative, and
just used to break down the statistics.

In some cases (the one I have in mind is qtype_opaque) then there is a
complex randomisation process, which may lead to several inital variant
numbers acutally giving the same version of the question. In this case
it is nice if the question can update the stored variant number, to make
the statistics more meaningful.

This is risky, because brewers have no idea that this is the case.
Suppose a brewer has gnutls brewed, and then brews msmtp with the
current official formula.  Then suppose the brewer removes gnutls later
but keeps msmtp.  Then msmtp will break, the user will have no idea why,
there probably will be a ticket, and no matter what the brewer will have
to rebrew.

It therefore seems better to explicitly ask msmtp to build against
openssl, since that isn't transient.  Msmtp will find the system's ssl.

For users who never brewed msmtp with gnutls already on their machines,
this commit changes nothing at all.

Closes Homebrew/homebrew#20756.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

There are several kinds of shuffle client, blockTransferService and externalShuffleClient.

For the externalShuffleClient,  there are relative external shuffle service, which guarantees  the shuffle block data and regardless the  state of executors.

For the blockTransferService, it is used to fetch broadcast block, and fetch the shuffle data when external shuffle service is not enabled.

When fetching data by using blockTransferService, the shuffle client would connect relative executor's blockManager, so if the relative executor is dead, it would never fetch successfully.

When spark.shuffle.service.enabled is true and spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled is true,  the executor will be removed while it has been idle  for more than idleTimeout.

If a blockTransferService create connection to relative executor successfully, but the relative executor is removed when beginning to fetch broadcast block, it would retry (see RetryingBlockFetcher), which is Ineffective.

If the spark.shuffle.io.retryWait and spark.shuffle.io.maxRetries is big,  such as 30s and 10 times, it would waste 5 minutes.

In this PR, we check whether relative executor is alive before retry.
## How was this patch tested?
Unit test.

Closes #24533 from turboFei/SPARK-27637.

node_e2e: configure gce images via config file

This file provides the abiliy to specify image project on a per-image
basis and is more extensible for future changes.

For backwards compatibility and local development convenience, the
existing flags are kept and should work.

The eventual goal is to be able to source some images, such as the CoreOS one (and possibly containervm one) from their upstream projects and do all new configuration changes via a cloud-init key added to the image config.

This PR is a first step there. A following PR will add a config key of `cloud-init` or `user-data` and migrate the CoreOS e2e to use that.

This motivation is driven by the fact that currently the changes needed for the CoreOS image can all be done quickly in cloud-init and this will make it much easier to update the image and ensure that changes are applied consistently.

There are still some algorithms based on mllib, such as KMeans. For now, many mllib common class (such as: Vector, DenseVector, SparseVector, Matrix, DenseMatrix, SparseMatrix) are not registered in Kryo. So there are some performance issues for those object serialization or deserialization.

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?

When we parse DDLs involving table or database properties, we need to validate the values.
E.g. if we alter a database's property without providing a value:
```
ALTER DATABASE my_db SET DBPROPERTIES('some_key')
```
Then we'll ignore it with Hive, but override the property with the in-memory catalog. Inconsistencies like these arise because we don't validate the property values.

In such cases, we should throw exceptions instead.

This commit changes the way libraries headers are included in source files:

 - If the header is in the same directory the source belongs to, so the
 notation '#include """"' is used with the path relative to the directory

 - If the header is outside the directory containing the source, then we use
 the notation '#include <>' with the path relative to libraries folder.

Some of the advantages of such approach:

 - Only one search path for libraries headers.

Run nvidia-gpu device-plugin daemonset as an addon on GCE nodes that have nvidia GPUs attached

- Instead of the old `Accelerators` feature that added `alpha.kubernetes.io/nvidia-gpu` resource, use the new `DevicePlugins` feature that adds vendor specific resources. (In case of nvidia GPUs it will
add `nvidia.com/gpu` resource.)

- Add node label to GCE nodes with accelerators attached. This node label is the same as what GKE attaches to node pools with accelerators attached. (For example, for nvidia-tesla-p100 GPU, the label would be `cloud.google.com/gke-accelerator=nvidia-tesla-p100`) This will help us target accelerator specific
daemonsets etc. to these nodes.

- Run nvidia-gpu device-plugin daemonset as an addon on GCE nodes that have nvidia GPUs attached.

- Some minor documentation improvements in addon manager.

**Release note**:
```release-note
GCE nodes with NVIDIA GPUs attached now expose `nvidia.com/gpu` as a resource instead of `alpha.kubernetes.io/nvidia-gpu`.

Add proxy for container streaming in kubelet for streaming auth.

For https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/36666, option 2 of https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/36666#issuecomment-378440458.

This PR:
1. Removed the `DirectStreamingRuntime`, and changed `IndirectStreamingRuntime` to `StreamingRuntime`. All `DirectStreamingRuntime`s, `dockertools` and `rkt`, were removed.
2. Proxy container streaming in kubelet instead of returning redirect to apiserver. This solves the container runtime authentication issue, which is what we agreed on in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/36666.

Please note that, this PR replaced the redirect with proxy directly instead of adding a knob to switch between the 2 behaviors. For existing CRI runtimes like containerd and cri-o, they should change to serve container streaming on localhost, so as to make the whole container streaming connection secure.

 If a general authentication mechanism proposed in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/62747 is ready, we can switch back to redirect, and all code can be found in github history.

Please also note that this added some overhead in kubelet when there are container streaming connections. However, the actual bottleneck is in the apiserver anyway, because it does proxy for all container streaming happens in the cluster. So it seems fine to get security and simplicity with this overhead. @derekwaynecarr @mrunalp Are you ok with this? Or do you prefer a knob?

@yujuhong @timstclair @dchen1107 @mikebrow @feiskyer 
/cc @kubernetes/sig-node-pr-reviews 
**Release note**:

```release-note
Kubelet now proxies container streaming between apiserver and container runtime. The connection between kubelet and apiserver is authenticated. Container runtime should change streaming server to serve on localhost, to make the connection between kubelet and container runtime local.

In this way, the whole container streaming connection is secure. To switch back to the old behavior, set `--redirect-container-streaming=true` flag.

## Description of change

This patch adds logic so that application leaders are retrieved from Raft for the `juju status` client command.

## QA steps

New Behaviour:
- Bootstrap.
- `juju deploy redis -n 3`. Leader should wind up as ""redis/0"".
- Change the leader lease in Mongo, for example: `db.leaseholders.updateOne({ ""_id"": ""<model-uuid>:application-leadership#redis#""}, {$set:{""holder"": ""redis/1""}})`
- Observe that the leader is still reported as ""redis/0"" as per Raft determination.

Regression:
- `juju controller-config features=[legacy-leases]`
- Restart the controller.
- Observe that the leader is ""redis/1"" as set in the DB.

Some devices are produced and sold under different names. To debloat
the buildroot but keeping it complete, new variables are introduced to
handle different namings. Below an example taken from a recent PR[0]

    DEVICE_VENDOR := Arcadyan
    DEVICE_MODEL := ARV4520PW
    DEVICE_ALT0_VENDOR := Vodafone
    DEVICE_ALT0_MODEL := Easybox 800
    DEVICE_ALT1_VENDOR := Airties
    DEVICE_ALT1_MODEL := WAV-281

With this commit the buildroot is extended to take care of up to three
alternative namings. The primary title plus alternatives names (if
defined) are shown in the `make menuconfig` dialog. Selecting on of
devices automatically selects all alternative names as they share the
same profile.

Introduce PodSecurityPolicy in the policy/v1beta1 API group

Types/constants are completely the same as in `extensions/v1beta1` except that they are located outside of the `extensions` API group.

**What this PR does / why we need it**:
This is the first step for migrating PSP-related stuff away of `extensions` group. See #43214 for more information.

Also it related to https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/5

**Example**:
```console
$ cat restricted2.yaml 
apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
kind: PodSecurityPolicy
metadata:
  name: restricted2
...
$ kubectl create -f restricted.yaml 
podsecuritypolicy ""restricted2"" created
$ kubectl get psp restricted2 -o yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: PodSecurityPolicy
...
```

**Release note**:
```release-note
The `PodSecurityPolicy` API has been moved to the `policy/v1beta1` API group. The `PodSecurityPolicy` API in the `extensions/v1beta1` API group is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

This PR added instrumented CRI service. Because we are adding the instrumented wrapper inside kuberuntime, it should work for both grpc and non-grpc integration.

This will be useful to compare latency difference between grpc and non-grpc integration, although there shouldn't be too much difference.

Instead of producing a tree of stacking contexts, display list
generation now produces a flat list of display items and a tree of
stacking contexts. This will eventually allow display list construction
to produce and modify WebRender vertex buffers directly, removing the
overhead of display list conversion.  This change also moves
layerization of the display list to the paint thread, since it isn't
currently useful for WebRender.

To accomplish this, display list generation now takes three passes of
the flow tree:

        1. Calculation of absolute positions.
        2. Collection of a tree of stacking contexts.
        3. Creation of a list of display items.

After collection of display items, they are sorted based upon the index
of their parent stacking contexts and their position in CSS 2.1
Appendeix E stacking order.

This is a big change, but it actually simplifies display list generation.

Using the lantiq,wan device tree property for one interface node and
the lantiq,switch device tree property for another interface node at
the same time was never intended/isn't supported at the moment.

The property is meant to be used in two phy operation mode where one
phy is assigned to an interface without lantiq,* device tree property
and the other phy is assigned to an interface with the lantiq,wan
device property to have two netdevs.

If both properties are used at the same time, the lantiq,wan interface
is shown as independent netdev but not able to operate independent. The
port needs to be managed via swconfig. These dependency is not obvious
and fooled already a lot of users.

Add a default WAN vlan for xrx200 devices having an ethernet WAN port
and remove the lantiq,wan device tree property. Leave it up to the user
to set the ethernet WAN port as default WAN interface or to use this
port as additional LAN port.

Beyond that the only existing OWNERS files for auth are `pkg/auth/OWNERS` and `plugin/pkg/auth/OWNERS` both of which include @liggitt and @erictune. There's also nothing in the `plugin/pkg/client` path. I'm a little unclear on the implications for future PRs that are assigned to me (e.g. webhook or RBAC reviews).

jfrazelle/kubernetes,7abe12d6f4a993f47c72f65a05583d1f7b690bcd,"Fix flaky mesos executor test

The TestExecutorFrameworkMessage test sends a ""task-lost:foo"" message to the
executor in order to mark a pod as lost. For that the pod must be running first.
Otherwise, the executor code will send ""TASK_FAILED"" status updates, not ""TASK_LOST"".

Before this patch there was no synchronization between the pod startup and the
test case. Moreover, in order to startup a task a working apiserver URL must be
passed to the executor which was not the case either.

This notebook demonstrates how to use seeded CNMF. As discussed in the hackathon, the recommended way is to load individual mask files for each neuron. This makes overlapping ROIs possible and transforming the data into csc_matrix format easier. Because I already wrote the code, I left the watershed processing for separating combined ROIs in, only marked it as 'not recommended'.

To do:
Use a better dataset with nice, premade mask files that the user can download.

The maximum number of processes a tasks on the system is usually lower
than what pid_t would allow, and is compiled into the kernel (and

we can adjust the pid_max sysctl without fearing invalid accesses.

The code in the deployer pod may reach the lifecycle hook execution
prior to the kubelet being able to update the pod status to ""running""
with a valid start time. This caused the deployer pod to panic because
start time was empty.

Since the window for this race is small, if the deployer pod can't see a
start time it can use `time.Now()` to bound the expiration window. Since
the process is reentrant, we can't use a start time at the beginning of
the deployer process (it's no more accurate that way).

A future change should guarantee the start time is available to the
container (via downward API, probably).

The environment.xml files in plugins force you to define the versions of Moodle that the checks should be carried out against.
For community plugins the environment requirements of the plugin seem unlikely to be dependant on the version of Moodle.

This patch will allow the environment.xml files to use a new <PLUGIN> tag in place of the <MOODLE version=""> tag.

This solution has the following properties:

* The Environment file will not break versions of Moodle that do not support the PLUGIN syntax.
* Specific versioned MOODLE tags can still be defined for versions of Moodle that do not have this patch.
* If both MOODLE and PLUGIN tags exist the PLUGIN tag will be used in preference.
* The PLUGIN tag will not function in the main Moodle environment.xml file.
* The PLUGIN tag has a mandatory name attribute that must match the frankenstyle name of the plugin being tested.

This is a PR based on some of @vene's work in scikit-learn: see

There are three enhancements:

- scipy.linalg.pinv2 is sped up by only computing necessary singular
  values, and not allocating the entire psigma matrix

- scipy.linalg.pinvh added: this uses eigh to significantly speed up the

When g_variant_get_child_value() is called for a child whose
serialisation is an empty byte string (which is possible), `bytes_data`
will be non-`NULL`, but `data` may be `NULL`. This results in a negative
offset being passed to `g_bytes_new_from_bytes()`, and a critical
warning.

So if `data` is `NULL`, set it to point to `bytes_data` so the offset is
calculated as zero. The actual value of the offset doesn’t matter, since
in this situation the size is always zero. An offset of zero is never
going to cause problems.

Why double touch probing is not a good thing.

It's widely believed we can get better __probing__ results when using a double touch when probing.

Let's compare to double touch __homing__.
Or better let's begin with single touch __homing__.
We home to find out out position, so our position is unknown.
To find the endstop we have to move into the direction of the endstop.
The maximum way we have to move is a bit longer than the axis length.
When we arrive at the endstop - when it triggers, the stepper pulses are stopped immediately.
It's a sudden stop. No smooth deacceleration is possible.
Depending on the speed and the moving mass we lose steps here.
Only if we approached slow enough (below jerk speed?) we will not lose steps.

Moving a complete axis length, that slow, takes for ever.
To speed up homing, we now make the first approach faster, get a guess about our position,
back up a bit and make a second slower approach to get a exact result without losing steps.

What we do in double touch probing is the same. But the difference here is:
a. we already know where we are
b. if the first approach is to fast we will lose steps here to.
But this time there is no second approach to set the position to 0. We are measuring only.
The lost steps are permanent until we home the next time.

So if you experienced permanently rising values in M48 you now know why. (Too fast, suddenly stopped, first approach)

What can we do to improve probing?
We can use the information about our current position.
We can make a really fast, but deaccelerated, move to a place we know it is a bit before the trigger point.
And then move the rest of the way really slow.

1. Added a min Android SDK version config to .buckconfig.
2. Added parsing of target manifests to buck project generation.
3. If generate manifests is enabled, project creation generates manifests with best option on min SDK using a combination of defaults from buck config and target specific manifests.

Automatic merge from submit-queue

Include system:authenticated group when impersonating

Fixes #43227

An authorized impersonation request solely for a specific username previously resulted in a `user.Info` that did not include either the `system:authenticated` or `system:unauthenticated` groups. That meant that permissions intended to be granted to all users, like discovery, would be denied the impersonated user.

This allows `kubectl get pods --as=<username>` to work as expected

The 'ResourceRequest' object sources information from three different
attributes of an instance: the instance's image metadata properties,
the instance's flavor, this flavor's extra specs. It's possible for a
user to override resources requested via the flavor using flavor extra
specs (e.g. using the 'resources:VCPU=N' extra spec), and it's possible
to override traits requested via the flavor extra specs using image
metadata (e.g. using the 'traits_required=foo' metadata property). This
means there's an implicit hierarchy present:

- Traits: image metadata > flavor extra specs
- Resources: flavor extra specs > flavor

Previously, we pulled information from the flavor extra specs and image
metadata using two classmethods, 'from_extra_specs' and
'from_image_props', but this required a lot of glue code in between to
ensure this hierarchy was maintained. Stop doing this, preferring to
centralize everything in one location. This results in fewer LoC and a
more grokable implementation, and will make things much easier when we
start handling 'PCPU's here.

This library is a prerequisite for the OpenDKIM package.

The proposed Makefile also contains sections for building Sendmail. These
sections are commented out because more work is necessary to properly
complete porting of Sendmail to LEDE/OpenWrt. The notes in Makefile

It has been verified that Sendmail executables compile and run properly

 Since record cannot be recursive, induction principles for them are
 just wasted ressources. With this patch, we turn off there generation
 by default. The flag ""Set/Unset Record Elimination Schemes"" allows
 to start producing them again.

 For compatibility, we adapt ""induction"" and similar tactics that
 rely on the existence of induction principles : on a record,
 ""induction"" is now silently converted into ""destruct"".

## What changes were proposed in this pull request?
org.codehaus.janino:janino depends on org.codehaus.janino:commons-compiler and we have been upgraded to org.codehaus.janino:janino 3.0.0.

However, seems we are still pulling in org.codehaus.janino:commons-compiler 2.7.6 because of calcite. It looks like an accident because we exclude janino from calcite (see here https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-2.1/pom.xml#L1759). So, this PR upgrades org.codehaus.janino:commons-compiler to 3.0.0.

1. Centralizes our logic for validating the correctness of our SWR files

Node E2E: Remove kubelet related flags

This PR:
1. **Add `KubeletConfig` in test context.** The configuration is dynamically retrieved from kubelet `configz/` endpoint after test node registers itself.
2. **Change tests to look at `KubeletConfig` instead of other kubelet related fields in test context.**
3. **Remove kubelet related flags from node e2e.** Add `kubelet-flags` to pass kubelet flags all together.

Why do we need this change?
1. This is required by **node soaking test and node conformance test**.
  * **For node soaking test.** We'll have one job start the test environment, and another job running the actual test again and again. It's hard to tell the test by flag how kubelet is configured.
  * **For node conformance test.** Kubelet is usually started by user. It's hard and troublesome to tell the test by flag how kubelet is configured.
2. **No need to add another flag in node e2e for each kubelet flag we want to set in the test.** Just directly add the kubelet flag into `kubelet-flags`.

In the future,
1. Kubelet start logic should be moved outside of the test. We should have standard kubelet launcher or standard cloud-init node setup script etc.
2. The test should validate kubelet configuration:
  * Whether the configuration is production ready?
  * Whether the configuration has conflicts?
  * Whether some configuration conflict with node e2e/conformance test is turned on (cloud provider etc.)? (Some configurations need to be turned off when running node e2e/conformance test)
  * ...

The `which` command in Fedora 20 (differently from the one in Debian)
prints to stderr when the binary is not found. Redirect both stdout and
stderr to /dev/null to prevent messages from being printed by `which`.

Check whether the binary exists or not by the exit status of `which`
(non-zero means the binary does not exist) instead of checking for empty
output.

Tested:
- Started a Vagrant cluster with `vagrant up` and confirmed these
  messages were gone. Checked master and minions for Kubernetes
  components using the systemd status commands.
- Confirmed that the same error message for salt-minion is also
  suppressed from the output with this patch.

having to have a sanity check in the runtime that the type definition

In HBASE-8370 ""Report data block cache hit rates apart from aggregate cache hit rates""
discussion highlights small changes in caching percentage can make for large
changes in cache contents; e.g. lots of data blocks may be getting evicited
but because meta blocks -- index and blooms -- are staying in cache with
high hit rates, a large data block eviction may show as a small change in
overall cache percentage (e.g. from 99.99 to 99.11).

Changes the getBlockCacheHitPercent from an int to a double.
Also changes name of the jmx metric blockCountHitPercent to be
blockCacheCountHitPercent instead.

2008-07-28  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Output to glibconfig.h typedefs for gintptr as the
	signed integer type that can hold a pointer, and guintptr as the
	corresponding unsigned type. These types are portable equivalents
	to intptr_t and uintptr_t which are not available in all
	compilers.

	For all current platforms, they will presumably end up as the same
	types as gssize and gsize, but in theory size_t can be smaller
	than intptr_t. Also, the intended use case for gintptr and
	guintptr is different from that of gssize and gsize. As the name
	indicates, gintptr is for when one wants an integer type that can
	hold a pointer, and gsize is for when one wants an integer type
	that can hold the value of the sizeof operator.

This commit switches over the HPA controller to use the custom metrics
API.  It also converts the HPA controller to use the generated client
in k8s.io/metrics for the resource metrics API.

In order to enable support, you must enable
`--horizontal-pod-autoscaler-use-rest-clients` on the
controller-manager, which will switch the HPA controller's MetricsClient
implementation over to use the standard rest clients for both custom
metrics and resource metrics.  This requires that at the least resource
metrics API is registered with kube-aggregator, and that the controller
manager is pointed at kube-aggregator.  For this to work, Heapster
must be serving the new-style API server (`--api-server=true`).

keszybz/systemd,c6134d3e2f1d1d17b32b6e06556cd0c5429bc78a,"path-util: get rid of prefix_root()

prefix_root() is equivalent to path_join() in almost all ways, hence
let's remove it.

There are subtle differences though: prefix_root() will try shorten
multiple ""/"" before and after the prefix. path_join() doesn't do that.
This means prefix_root() might return a string shorter than both its
inputs combined, while path_join() never does that. I like the
path_join() semantics better, hence I think dropping prefix_root() is
totally OK. In the end the strings generated by both functon should
always be identical in terms of path_equal() if not streq().

This leaves prefix_roota() in place. Ideally we'd have path_joina(), but
I don't think we can reasonably implement that as a macro. or maybe we
can? (if so, sounds like something for a later PR)

Also remove code in erl_parse that handles abstract code that has
passed through sys_pre_expand.

We considered deprecating sys_pre_expand just in case, but decided
against it for the following reasons:

- Anyone brave and knowledgeable enough to use sys_pre_expand should
be able to cope with sys_pre_expand being removed.

- If we kept it, but didn't test it anywhere in OTP, it could

In SparkContext method `setCheckpointDir`, a warning is issued when spark master is not local and the passed directory for the checkpoint dir appears to be local.

In practice, when relying on HDFS configuration file and using a relative path for the checkpoint directory (using an incomplete URI without HDFS scheme, ...), this warning should not be issued and might be confusing.
In fact, in this case, the checkpoint directory is successfully created, and the checkpointing mechanism works as expected.

This PR uses the `FileSystem` instance created with the given directory, and checks whether it is local or not.
(The rationale is that since this same `FileSystem` instance is used to create the checkpoint dir anyway and can therefore be reliably used to determine if it is local or not).

The warning is only issued if the directory is not local, on top of the existing conditions.

The cache coherency of rasterization for full-screen passes is better
using an oversized triangle that is clipped rather than two triangles.
Traversal order of rasterization is GPU-specific, but will almost
certainly be better using an undivided primitive.

A smaller benefit is that quads along the diagonal are not evaluated
multiple times, but that's minor in comparison.

Redo format shaders to bypass vertex buffer, and input layout. Add
global shader bool ""obs_glsl_compile"" to make API-specific decisions,
i.e. handle upside-down UVs. gl_ortho is not needed for format
conversion because the vertex shader does not use ViewProj anymore.

This can be applied to more situations, but start small first.

Automatic merge from submit-queue

Allow expressing inodes in percentages for eviction

Per discussion here:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/28055#issuecomment-230078770

The amount of inodes per disk can vary, and our operators would prefer to express eviction in terms of percentage available.  So independent of a disk having 3.2M or 12M of total inodes, its more convenient to just express eviction as saying if available inodes falls below 10 or 5 percent of total capacity then trigger an action.

Attaching requestResize to onResizeDenied would invert the height &

Our funny convention holds that passing ticks==1 to _add_timeout()
means ""at the next tick"".  But that means that 1, 0, and all negative
numbers are expected to behave the same.  In ticked mode, that's fine
because it will, after all, expire at the next tick.

But in tickless, the next announcement may be for several ticks, and
that zero will appear to expire ""before"" the next tick in the
consumption loop.

Taeung/tip,0ce187c4f32d77eae077f249aa10656b5eef5f28,"nilfs2: put out gfp mask manipulation from nilfs_set_inode_flags()

nilfs_set_inode_flags() function adjusts gfp-mask of inode->i_mapping as
well as i_flags, however, this coupling of operations is not appropriate.

For instance, nilfs_ioctl_setflags(), one of three callers of
nilfs_set_inode_flags(), doesn't need to reinitialize the gfp-mask at all.
 In addition, nilfs_new_inode(), another caller of
nilfs_set_inode_flags(), doesn't either because it has already initialized
the gfp-mask.

Only __nilfs_read_inode(), the remaining caller, needs it.  So, this moves
the gfp mask manipulation to __nilfs_read_inode() from
nilfs_set_inode_flags().

By exposing this information to a client, and giving it explicit control

The immediate effect of this is that on GPUs where CE0 is the ""GRCE"", we
will now be allocating a copy engine running asynchronously to GR for BO

When we want to selectively do a LAYOUTRETURN, we need to specify a
stateid that represents most recent layout acquisition that is to be
returned.

When we mark a layout stateid to be returned, we update the return
sequence number in the layout header with that value, if it's newer
than the existing one. Then, when we go to do a LAYOUTRETURN on
layout header put, we overwrite the seqid in the stateid with the
saved one, and then zero it out.

Currently if a driver is not loaded for a device, we will not
respond to the device create until it is done. This causes

could be assigned to a guest that don't have an actual

has responded that it is done with the device.

Taeung/tip,24928634f81b1592e83b37dcd89ed45c28f12feb,"f2fs: check the node block address of newly allocated nid

This patch adds a routine which checks the block address of newly allocated nid.
If an nid has already allocated by other thread due to subtle data races, it
will result in filesystem corruption.
So, it needs to check whether its block address was already allocated or not
in prior to nid allocation as the last chance.

Our arm64_skip_faulting_instruction() helper advances the userspace
singlestep state machine, but this is also called by the kernel BRK
handler, as used for WARN*().

Thus, if we happen to hit a WARN*() while the user singlestep state
machine is in the active-no-pending state, we'll advance to the
active-pending state without having executed a user instruction, and
will take a step exception earlier than expected when we return to
userspace.

Let's fix this by only advancing the state machine when skipping a user
instruction.

After resume from hibernate on arm64, any amd-xgbe devices that were
running when we hibernated are reported as down, even when it is not.

Re-plugging the cables does not cause the interface to come back, the
link must be marked as down then up via 'ip set link' using the serial
console.

This happens because the device has been power-cycled and possibly
re-initialised by firmware, whereas the driver's memory structures have
been restored from the hibernate image and the two do not agree.

Schedule a restart of the device after powerup in case the world changed
while we were asleep.

Moreover, if acpi_scan_attach_handler() is called then, it may

Pingmin/linux,68bdc8d64742ccc5e340c5d122ebbab3f0cf2a74,"mm: try_to_unuse check removing right swap

There's a possible race in try_to_unuse() which Nick Piggin led me to two
years ago.  Where it does lock_page() after read_swap_cache_async(), what
if another task removed that page from swapcache just before we locked it?

It would sail though the (*swap_map > 1) tests doing nothing (because it
could not have been removed from swapcache before its swap references were
gone), until it reaches the delete_from_swap_cache(page) near the bottom.

Now imagine that this page has been allocated to swap on a different swap
area while we dropped page lock (perhaps at the top, perhaps in unuse_mm):
we could wrongly remove from swap cache before the page has been written
to swap, so a subsequent do_swap_page() would read in stale data from
swap.

I think this case could not happen before: remove_exclusive_swap_page()
refused while page count was raised.  But now with reuse_swap_page() and
try_to_free_swap() removing from swap cache without minding page count, I
think it could happen - the previous patch argued that it was safe because
try_to_unuse() already ignored page count, but overlooked that it might be
breaking the assumptions in try_to_unuse() itself.

This is the very basic stuff without the changing canary upon

Since in the DT case, the linear domain path will not allocate
descriptors for the IRQs, we need to use irq_create_mapping()
for mapping hwirqs to Linux IRQs, so these descriptors get
created on-the-fly in this case.

ChangeLog v1->v2:

- Just use irq_create_mapping() in the .to_irq function since
  this is called before unmasking or enabling any interrupt
  lines, so irq_find_mapping() should be sufficient for the
  IRQ handler function.

Dave gave me an image of a very full file system that would abort the
transaction because it ran out of space while committing the transaction.
This is because we would think there was plenty of room to create a snapshot
even though the global reserve was not full.  This happens because we
calculate the global reserve size before we unpin any space, so after we
unpin the space we allow reservations to occur even though we haven't
reserved all of the space for our global reserve.  Fix this by adding to the
global reserve while unpinning in order to make sure we always have enough
space to do our work.  With this patch we no longer end up with an aborted
transaction, we return ENOSPC properly to the person trying to create the

Let the compiler figure out what I915_MAX_PLANES is from 'enum plane' so
that we don't need a separate #define.

While we're at it, add the cursor plane to the enum.  This will cause
I915_MAX_PLANES to now include the cursor plane in its count (it didn't
previously).   This change is safe since we currently only use this
value in array declarations (never in the actual code logic); we just
wind up allocating slightly more memory than we need to.  A followup
patch will cause various parts of the code to start using the extra
array element where appropriate.

(This patch probably should have been squashed with the followup patch,
but I couldn't figure out how to get Coccinelle to modify enum
declarations...)

currently, md updates all superblocks (one on each device) in series.  It
waits for one write to complete before starting the next.  This isn't a big
problem as superblock updates don't happen that often.

However it is neater to do it in parallel, and if the drives in the array have
gone to ""sleep"" after a period of idleness, then waking them is parallel is
faster (and someone else should be worrying about power drain).

Futher, we will need parallel superblock updates for a future patch which
keeps the intent-logging bitmap near the superblock.

Also remove the silly code that retired superblock updates 100 times.  This
simply never made sense.

The 'char name[BTRFS_PATH_NAME_MAX]' member of struct btrfs_ioctl_vol_args
is passed directly to strlen() after being copied from user. I haven't
verified this, but in theory a userspace program could pass in an
unterminated string and cause a kernel crash as strlen walks off the end of
the array.

This patch terminates the ->name string in all btrfs ioctl functions which
currently use a 'struct btrfs_ioctl_vol_args'. Since the string is now
properly terminated, it's length will never be longer than
BTRFS_PATH_NAME_MAX so that error check has been removed.

By the way, it might be better overall to just have the ioctl pass an
unterminated string + length structure but I didn't bother with that since
it'd change the kernel/user interface.

The BE dai link cannot however be unloaded in snd_soc_tplg_component
_remove(), which is problematic if anything needs to be released or
reinitialized.

This patch aligns the definitions of dynamic types with the existing

If INPUT_PROP_DIRECT is set, userspace doesn't have to fall back to old
ways of identifying touchscreen devices.

In order to identify a touchscreen device, Android for example, seems to
already depend on INPUT_PROP_DIRECT to be present in drivers. udev still
checks for either BTN_TOUCH or INPUT_PROP_DIRECT. Checking for BTN_TOUCH
however can quite easily lead to false positives; it's a code that not only
touchscreen device drivers use.

According to the documentation, touchscreen drivers should have this
property set and in order to make life easy for userspace, let's set it.

Michael Chan noted that there is nothing in the code that would prevent
the compiler from delaying the access of the ""mapping"" member of the
newly arrived packet until much later.  If this happened after the
skb = NULL assignment, it is possible for the driver to pass a bad
dma_addr value to pci_unmap_single().  To enforce this ordering, we need
a write memory barrier.  The pairing read memory barrier already exists
in tg3_rx_prodring_xfer() under the comments starting with
""Ensure that updates to the..."".

Declare mb86a16_config structure as const as it is either passed as

calls its first argument on the rest of its arguments. The first argument
of dvb_attach in the changed case is mb86a16_attach and the parameter of
this function to which the object reference is passed is of type
const. So, mb86a16_config structures having this property can be made
const.

The pages_shared and pages_sharing counts give a good picture of how
successful KSM is at sharing; but no clue to how much wasted work it's
doing to get there.  Add pages_unshared (count of unique pages waiting
in the unstable tree, hoping to find a mate) and pages_volatile.

pages_volatile is harder to define.  It includes those pages changing
too fast to get into the unstable tree, but also whatever other edge
conditions prevent a page getting into the trees: a high value may
deserve investigation.  Don't try to calculate it from the various
conditions: it's the total of rmap_items less those accounted for.

Also show full_scans: the number of completed scans of everything
registered in the mm list.

The locking for all these counts is simply ksm_thread_mutex.

Some of the gate clocks are described as ""just in case"" bits in the
datasheet. Examples are the ABP, PERIPH, AXI and L2 DRAM clocks on
Meson8b.
The datasheet suggests that these bits are not touched. The full
explanation is:
""Set to 1 to manually disable the [...] clock when changing the mux
selection. Typically this bit is set to 0 since the clock muxes can
switch without glitches."".

This adds new read-only ops for gate clocks so we can describe these
clocks in our clock controller drivers while ensuring that we can't
accidentally modify the registers.

As the backend and TCON are always paired together and form the CRTC,
we need to know which backend or TCON we are currently probing, so we
can pair them when initializing the CRTC.

This patch figures out the backend's ID from the device tree and stores
it in the backend's data structure. It does this by looking at the ""reg""
property of any remote endpoints connected to the backend's input port.

ipwireless_network_create() calls kzalloc() with GFP_ATOMIC,

ceph_calc_file_object_mapping() takes (among other things) a ""file""
offset and length, and based on the layout, determines the object
number (""bno"") backing the affected portion of the file's data and
the offset into that object where the desired range begins.  It also
computes the size that should be used for the request--either the
amount requested or something less if that would exceed the end of
the object.

This patch changes the input length parameter in this function so it
is used only for input.  That is, the argument will be passed by
value rather than by address, so the value provided won't get
updated by the function.

The value would only get updated if the length would surpass the
current object, and in that case the value it got updated to would
be exactly that returned in *oxlen.

Only one of the two callers is affected by this change.  Update
ceph_calc_raw_layout() so it records any updated value.

shld is a very high latency operation. Instead of emitting it for shifts of
two or three, open code the equivalent operation which is faster on athlon
and P4 (by a substantial margin).

For example, instead of compiling this:

long long X2(long long Y) { return Y << 2; }

to:

X3_2:
        movl 4(%esp), %eax
        movl 8(%esp), %edx
        shldl $2, %eax, %edx
        shll $2, %eax
        ret

Compile it to:

X2:
        movl 4(%esp), %eax
        movl 8(%esp), %ecx
        movl %eax, %edx
        shrl $30, %edx
        leal (%edx,%ecx,4), %edx
        shll $2, %eax
        ret

Likewise, for << 3, compile to:

X3:
        movl 4(%esp), %eax
        movl 8(%esp), %ecx
        movl %eax, %edx
        shrl $29, %edx
        leal (%edx,%ecx,8), %edx

This matches icc, except that icc open codes the shifts as adds on the P4.

adv7511_probe() is never called in atomic context.
This function is only set as "".probe"" in struct i2c_driver.

Despite never getting called from atomic context, adv7511_probe()
calls mdelay() to busily wait.
This is not necessary and can be replaced with usleep_range() to
avoid busy waiting.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
And I also manually check it.

The master bit to enable SDIO interrupts can only be accessed if
SCLKDIVEN bit allows that. However, the core uses the SDIO enable
callback at times when SCLKDIVEN forbids the change. This leads to
""timeout waiting for SD bus idle"" messages.

We now activate the master bit in probe once if SDIO is supported. IRQ
en-/disabling will be done now by the individual IRQ enablement bits
only.

In this case, AUX channel voltage level can be changed from 400 mV
to 800 mV, when resistance between AUX TX and RX is 100 ohm.

According to DP spec, although the normative voltage level is 390 mV,
the informative voltage level is 430 mV. So, 800 mV can be helpful
to improve voltage margin of AUX channel.

We use the vblank timestamps to generate the vblank frame counter value
on gen2. That means we need the pipe scanout position to be accurate
when we call drm_crtc_vblank_on(), otherwise the frame counter
guesstimate may jump when the pipe actually start.

What I observed on my 85x is that the DSL initially reads 0, and when
the pipe actually starts DSL jumps to vblank_start. On gen2 DSL==0 means
actually vtotal-1 (see update_scanline_offset()), so if we initially
get vtotal-1, and then very quickly vblank_start (or thereabouts), the
scanout position will appear to jump backwards by approximately one
vblank length. Which means the frame counter guesstimate will also
jump backwards. That's no good, so let's make sure the pipe has
started before we call drm_crtc_vblank_on().

openwrt-es/linux,0793a61d4df8daeac6492dbf8d2f3e5713caae5e,"performance counters: core code

Implement the core kernel bits of Performance Counters subsystem.

The Linux Performance Counter subsystem provides an abstraction of
performance counter hardware capabilities. It provides per task and per
CPU counters, and it provides event capabilities on top of those.

Performance counters are accessed via special file descriptors.
There's one file descriptor per virtual counter used.

The special file descriptor is opened via the perf_counter_open()
system call:

 int
 perf_counter_open(u32 hw_event_type,
                   u32 hw_event_period,
                   u32 record_type,
                   pid_t pid,
                   int cpu);

The syscall returns the new fd. The fd can be used via the normal
VFS system calls: read() can be used to read the counter, fcntl()
can be used to set the blocking mode, etc.

Multiple counters can be kept open at a time, and the counters
can be poll()ed.

See more details in Documentation/perf-counters.txt.

'rfcomm connect' will trigger lockdep warnings which is caused by
locking diffrent kinds of bluetooth sockets at the same time.

So using sub-classes per AF_BLUETOOTH sub-type for lockdep.

Thanks for the hints from dave jones.

The only other way to catch these would have been to monitor
the Tx deauth event, but we can send a deauth when we roam.
So it would have been tricky to make sure we capture the
connection losses only.
Define a separate trigger for the connection losses to make
it easier to catch them.

Currently __i2400m_dev_start was forcing, after uploading firmware and
doing a few checks to WIMAX_ST_UNINITIALIZED.

This can be overriding state changes that the device might have caused
by sending reports; thus it makes more sense to remove it and let the
device update the status on its own by sending reports.

If an RTC alarm fires just as suspend is happening, it is possible for
suspend to complete and the alarm to be missed.

To avoid the race, we must register the event with the PM core.

As the event is made visible to userspace through a thread which is
only scheduled by the interrupt, we need a pm_stay_awake/pm_relax
pair preventing suspend from the interrupt until the thread completes
its work.

This makes the pm_wakeup_event() call in cmos_interrupt unnecessary as
it provides suspend protection for all RTCs that use rtc_update_irq.

When the function tracer starts modifying the code via breakpoints
it sets a variable (modifying_ftrace_code) to inform the breakpoint
handler to call the ftrace int3 code.

But there's no synchronization between setting this code and the
handler, thus it is possible for the handler to be called on another
CPU before it sees the variable. This will cause a kernel crash as
the int3 handler will not know what to do with it.

I originally added smp_mb()'s to force the visibility of the variable
but H. Peter Anvin suggested that I just make it atomic.

Device mapper saves and restores various fields in the bio, but it doesn't save
bi_io_vec.  If the device driver modifies this after a partially successful

bi_size inconsistent with the size of vector.

To make requests resubmittable in dm-raid1 and dm-multipath, we must save
and restore the bio vector as well.

To reduce the memory overhead involved in this, we do not save the pages in a
vector and use a 16-bit field size if the page size is less than 65536.

This is more complicated than the 32-bit and compat cases
because it preserves an asm fast path for the case where the
callee-saved regs aren't needed in pt_regs and no entry or exit
work needs to be done.

This appears to slow down fastpath syscalls by no more than one
cycle on my Skylake laptop.

When polled input device is opened and closed and there are no other
users of polled device, the workqueue is created and destroyed in
every open / close operation. It is probable that at some point
dynamic allocation of internal parts of the workqueue cause changes to the
workqueue.

When a work is queued to the workqueue the work struct contains pointers
to the workqueue data. If the workqueue has been changed and the work
has never been queued to the new workqueue, work-struct contains pointers
to the non-existing workqueue. This will cause crash at the work
cancellation during device close since cancellation of a work assumes
that the workqueue exists.

To prevent that, work struct is cleaned up at device close. This keeps
work struct clean for the next use.

Exception handlers are aligned to 128 bytes (L1 cache) on 64s, which is
overkill. It can reduce the icache footprint of any individual exception
path. However taken as a whole, the expansion in icache footprint seems
likely to be counter-productive and cause more total misses.

Create IFETCH_ALIGN_SHIFT/BYTES, which should give optimal ifetch
alignment with much more reasonable alignment. This saves 1792 bytes
from head_64.o text with an allmodconfig build.

Other subarchitectures should define appropriate IFETCH_ALIGN_SHIFT
values if this becomes more widely used.

Some MTD drivers return -EINVAL if the 'phys' parameter is not NULL, trying to
convey that they cannot return the physical address. However, this is not very
logical because they still can return the virtual address ('virt'). But some
drivers (lpddr) just ignore the 'phys' parameter instead, which is a more
logical thing to do.

Let's harmonize this and:

1. Always initialize 'virt' and 'phys' to 'NULL' in 'mtd_point()'.
2. Do not return an error if the physical address cannot be found.

So as a result, all drivers will set 'phys' to 'NULL' if it is not supported.
None of the 'mtd_point()' users use 'phys' anyway, so this should not break
anything. I guess we could also just delete this parameter later.

There is a L2CAP protocol race between the local peer and
the remote peer demanding disconnection of the L2CAP link.

When L2CAP ERTM is used, l2cap_sock_shutdown() can be called
from userland to disconnect L2CAP. However, there can be a
delay introduced by waiting for ACKs. During this waiting
period, the remote peer may have sent a Disconnection Request.
Therefore, recheck the shutdown status of the socket
after waiting for ACKs because there is no need to do
further processing if the connection has gone.

Replace send_sig_info in zap_pid_ns_processes with

group is being killed.  More importantly this allows the kill of those
processes with PIDTYPE_MAX to indicate all of the process in the pid

Admittedly fork has another case to catch SIGKILL but the principle remains
that it is desirable to know when a group of processes is being signaled.

While testing the performance of different receive interrupt
coalescing settings on a single stream TCP benchmark, I noticed two
very different results. With rx-usecs=50, most of the time a
connection would hit 8280 Mbps but once in a while it would hit
9330 Mbps.

It turns out we are only applying the interrupt coalescing settings
to the first queue and whenever the rx hash would direct us onto
that queue we ran faster.

With this patch applied and rx-usecs=50, I get 9330 Mbps
consistently.

Turns out Hyper-V on KVM (as of 2016) will only use synthetic timers
if direct mode is available. With direct mode we notify the guest by
asserting APIC irq instead of sending a SynIC message.

The implementation uses existing vec_bitmap for letting lapic code
know that we're interested in the particular IRQ's EOI request. We assume
that the same APIC irq won't be used by the guest for both direct mode
stimer and as sint source (especially with AutoEOI semantics). It is
unclear how things should be handled if that's not true.

Direct mode is also somewhat less expensive; in my testing
stimer_send_msg() takes not less than 1500 cpu cycles and
stimer_notify_direct() can usually be done in 300-400. WS2016 without
Hyper-V, however, always sticks to non-direct version.

The motivating case for this involves a memmove to a buffer which is constant down a path which is dynamically dead.

Note that I'm choosing to implement the less aggressive of two possible semantics here. We could simply say that the store *is undefined*, and prune the path. Consensus in the review was that the more aggressive form might be a good follow on change at a later date.

There are two motivations for this patch. The first one is a preparation
for support MIPS TLS relocations. It might sound like a joke but for GOT
entries related to TLS relocations MIPS ABI uses almost regular approach
with creation of dynamic relocations for each GOT enty etc. But we need
to separate these 'regular' TLS related entries from MIPS specific local
and global parts of GOT. ABI declare simple solution - all TLS related
entries allocated at the end of GOT after local/global parts. The second
motivation it to support GOT relocations for non-preemptible symbols
with addends. If we have more than one GOT relocations against symbol S
with different addends we need to create GOT entries for each unique
Symbol/Addend pairs.

So we store all MIPS GOT entries in separate containers. For non-preemptible
symbols we have to maintain two data structures. The first one is MipsLocal
vector. Each entry corresponds to the GOT entry from the 'local' part
of the GOT contains the symbol's address plus addend. The second one
is MipsLocalMap. It is a map from Symbol/Addend pair to the GOT index.

We have to widen the operands to 32 bits and then we can either use

At the moment it is not enough to set the Legalizer action to
WidenScalar, since for libcalls it won't know what to do (it won't be
able to find what size to widen to, because it will find Libcall and not

Summary:
This patch turns on `LIBCXX_ENABLE_ABI_LINKER_SCRIPT` by default whenever `LLVM_HAVE_LINK_VERSION_SCRIPT` is ON. This turns out to be whenever:

1. WIN32 is not defined.
2 UNIX is defined.
3. APPLE is not defined.

While `LLVM_HAVE_LINK_VERSION_SCRIPT` is meant to reflect exactly what we are asking I think it's close enough.

commit 2f533844242 (tcp: allow splice() to build full TSO packets) added
a regression for splice() calls using SPLICE_F_MORE.

We need to call tcp_flush() at the end of the last page processed in
tcp_sendpages(), or else transmits can be deferred and future sends
stall.

Add a new internal flag, MSG_SENDPAGE_NOTLAST, acting like MSG_MORE, but
with different semantic.

For all sendpage() providers, its a transparent change. Only
sock_sendpage() and tcp_sendpages() can differentiate the two different
flags provided by pipe_to_sendpage()

Any block based fs (this patch includes ext3) just has to declare its own
fiemap() function and then call this generic function with its own
get_block_t. This works well for block based filesystems that will map
multiple contiguous blocks at one time, but will work for filesystems that
only map one block at a time, you will just end up with an ""extent"" for each
block. One gotcha is this will not play nicely where there is hole+data
after the EOF. This function will assume its hit the end of the data as soon
as it hits a hole after the EOF, so if there is any data past that it will
not pick that up. AFAIK no block based fs does this anyway, but its in the
comments of the function anyway just in case.

Current code does integer division (min_vol = min_uV / 1000) before pass
min_vol to max8997_get_voltage_proper_val().
So it is possible min_vol is truncated to a smaller value.

For example, if the request min_uV is 800900 for ldo.
min_vol = 800900 / 1000 = 800 (mV)
Then max8997_get_voltage_proper_val returns 800 mV for this case which is lower
than the requested voltage.

Use uV rather than mV in voltage_map_desc to prevent truncation by integer
division.

For client STA interfaces, ieee80211_do_stop unsets the relevant
interface's SDATA_STATE_RUNNING state bit prior to cancelling an
interrupted scan.  When ieee80211_offchannel_return is invoked as
part of cancelling the scan, it doesn't bother unsetting the
SDATA_STATE_OFFCHANNEL bit because it sees that the interface is
down.  Normally this doesn't matter because when the client STA
interface is brought back up, it will probably issue a scan.  But
in some cases (e.g., the user changes the interface type while it
is down), the SDATA_STATE_OFFCHANNEL bit will remain set.  This
prevents the interface queues from being started.  So we
cancel the scan before unsetting the SDATA_STATE_RUNNING bit.

Speakup opens tty using tty_open_by_driver. When closing, it calls
tty_ldisc_release but doesn't close and remove the tty itself. As a
result, that tty cannot be opened from user space. This patch calls
tty_release_struct which ensures that tty is safely removed and freed
up. It also calls tty_ldisc_release, so speakup doesn't need to call it.

Every time I tried to upgrade my laptop from 3.10.x to 4.x I faced an
issue by which the fan would run at full speed upon resume. Bisecting
it showed me the issue was introduced in 3.17 by commit 821d6f0359b0
(ACPI / sleep: Do not save NVS for new machines to accelerate S3). This
code only affects machines built starting as of 2012, but this Asus
1025C laptop was made in 2012 and apparently needs the NVS data to be
saved, otherwise the CPU's thermal state is not properly reported on
resume and the fan runs at full speed upon resume.

Here's a very simple way to check if such a machine is affected :

  # cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp
  55000

  ( now suspend, wait one second and resume )

  # cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp
  0

  (and after ~15 seconds the fan starts to spin)

Let's apply the same quirk as commit cbc00c13 (ACPI: save NVS memory
for Lenovo G50-45) and reuse the function it provides. Note that this
commit was already backported to 4.9.x but not 4.4.x.

Simple addition of the TimeSync commands defined in the specification.

Adds:
- svc.c::timesync_enable(u8 count, u64 frame_time, u32 strobe_delay,
                         u32 refclk)
  Commands the SVC to initiate count TimeSync strobe pulses with
  strobe_delay microseconds delay between each strobe to the specified
  bit-mask of Interface IDs indicated in a previous
  timesync_wake_pins_acquire command. The frame_time parameter indicates
  the initial time the SVC should base the first strobe from. The refclk
  parameter indicates the APs clock rate, the SVC should ensure its own
  clock ticks at this rate. Once enabled the SVC may not enter a low-power
  mode which will result in the reference timer used to track time
  switching off. The SVC will capture the authoritative FrameTime at each
  strobe and store these values for later propagation to the AP with the
  timesync_authoritative request.

- svc.c::timesync_disable(void)
  Commands the SVC to immediately halt TimeSync logic. This will allow
  the SVC to transition into low-power modes where the reference timer
  being used for TimeSync may switch off.

- svc.c::timesync_authoritative(u64 *frame_time)
  Used by the AP Module to ask the SVC for the authoritative FrameTime
  as captured at each TimeSync strobe.

- svc.c::timesync_ping(u64 *frame_time)
  Used by the AP Module to command the SVC to initiate a single strobe on
  a specified bit-mask of Interface IDs communicated in a previous
  timesync_wake_pins_acquire command. SVC will latch the FrameTime on the
  rising edge of the outbound pulse and will return the FrameTime to the
  AP Module in the response phase of the greybus transaction.

- svc::timesync_wake_pins_acquire(u32 strobe_mask)
  Used by the AP to tell the SVC to set a bit-mask of wake lines associated
  with a bit-mask of Interface IDs to a known initial state prior to the
  SVC generating a TimeSync related pulse such as timesync-enable or
  timesync-ping.

- svc::timesync_wake_pins_release(void)
  Used by the AP to tell the SVC to release all wake-detect lines in the
  timesync active state as previously specified in the
  timesync_wake_pins_acquire operation.

Move to using RCU access to a peer's service connection tree when routing
an incoming packet.  This is done using a seqlock to trigger retrying of
the tree walk if a change happened.

Further, we no longer get a ref on the connection looked up in the
data_ready handler unless we queue the connection's work item - and then
only if the refcount > 0.


Note that I'm avoiding the use of a hash table for service connections
because each service connection is addressed by a 62-bit number
(constructed from epoch and connection ID >> 2) that would allow the client
to engage in bucket stuffing, given knowledge of the hash algorithm.
Peers, however, are hashed as the network address is less controllable by
the client.  The total number of peers will also be limited in a future
commit.

We expect all CPUs to be running at the same EL inside the kernel
with or without VHE enabled and we have strict checks to ensure
that any mismatch triggers a kernel panic. If VHE is enabled,
we use the feature based on the boot CPU and all other CPUs
should follow. This makes it a perfect candidate for a capability
based on the boot CPU,  which should be matched by all the CPUs
(both when is ON and OFF). This saves us some not-so-pretty
hooks and special code, just for verifying the conflict.

The patch also makes the VHE capability entry depend on
CONFIG_ARM64_VHE.

CL2600/CL2800 servers leveraged Proliant hardware but are targeted to a
different market segment and come with a different firmware base. Based
upon targeted market needs, the servers de-featured certain aspects of iLO.

As a result, hpilo driver still claims the hardware but is not functional,
so we decided to blacklist it with SSID 0x0289 to reduce confusion to

c0d3z3r0/linux-rockchip,a9a2c44ff0a1350f8bfe3a162ecf71b1c9ce5cc2,"[PATCH] ipmi: add timer thread

We must poll for responses to commands when interrupts aren't in use.  The
default poll interval is based on using a kernel timer, which varies with HZ.
For character-based interfaces like KCS and SMIC though, that can be way too
slow (>15 minutes to flash a new firmware with KCS, >20 seconds to retrieve
the sensor list).

This creates a low-priority kernel thread to poll more often.  If the state
machine is idle, so is the kernel thread.  But if there's an active command,
it polls quite rapidly.  This decrease a firmware flash time from 15 minutes
to 1.5 minutes, and the sensor list time to 4.5 seconds, on a Dell PowerEdge
x8x system.

The timer-based polling remains, to ensure some amount of responsiveness even
under high user process CPU load.

Checking for a stopped timer at rmmod now uses atomics and del_timer_sync() to
ensure safe stoppage.

This patch sets number of free sba_request created by
sba_prealloc_channel_resources() to be:
<number_of_mailbox_channels> x 8192

Due to above, we will have sufficient number of free
sba_request and prep_xxx() callbacks failing is very
unlikely.
