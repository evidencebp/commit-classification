When the compiler reports back the error to CompilationUnit created by Eval#mkUnit, it sometimes returns OffsetPosition whose `source` is set to `NoSourceFile`.

This causes ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The current workaround is to pattern match on the passed in pos and create a new one when the incoming source looks suspicious.
I have not figured out whether this is caused by our macro code or compiler.

Fixes #3431

When a pane item is moved to another pane, we *detach* the associated
view but we don’t fully remove it. This was to prevent removing a view
when it was used as the pane item directly. However, this was causing
the editor component not to be unmounted, which caused leaks and
incorrect measurements.

We need to unmount the component, but we don’t want to destroy the
editor. So I’ve moved editor destruction to the wrapper view for now,
and I only do it when the view is actually removed.

Ultimately, we need to have a 1:1 relationship with pane items and their
views and only allow a pane item to appear once in the pane tree. Then
we can recycle the same view and avoid this confusing situation where
the old view is detached and a new view is created.
