Fixes #3431

When a pane item is moved to another pane, we *detach* the associated
view but we don’t fully remove it. This was to prevent removing a view
when it was used as the pane item directly. However, this was causing
the editor component not to be unmounted, which caused leaks and
incorrect measurements.

We need to unmount the component, but we don’t want to destroy the
editor. So I’ve moved editor destruction to the wrapper view for now,
and I only do it when the view is actually removed.

Ultimately, we need to have a 1:1 relationship with pane items and their
views and only allow a pane item to appear once in the pane tree. Then
we can recycle the same view and avoid this confusing situation where
the old view is detached and a new view is created.

*Styled Layer Descriptor profile of the Web Map Service* : DescribeLayer

http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sld

Defining a user-defined style requires information about the features being
 symbolized, or at least their feature/coverage type. Since user-defined styles
 can be applied to a named layer, there needs to be a mechanism by which a
 client can obtain feature/coverage-type information for a named layer. This is
 another example of bridging the gap between the WMS concepts of layers and
 styles and WFS/WCS concepts such as feature-type and coverage layer. To allow
 this, a WMS may optionally support the DescribeLayer request.

DescribeLayer method has been thought to be a better approach than overloading
 the WMS capabilities document even more.

For each named layer, the description should indicate if it is indeed based on
 feature data and if so it should indicate the WFS/WCS (by a URL prefix) and
 the feature/coverage types. Note that it is perfectly valid for a named layer
 not to be describable in this way.

Taeung/tip,8c56cacc724c7650b893d43068fa66044aa29a61,"libata: fix unexpectedly frozen port after ata_eh_reset()

To work around controllers which can't properly plug events while
reset, ata_eh_reset() clears error states and ATA_PFLAG_EH_PENDING
after reset but before RESET is marked done.  As reset is the final
recovery action and full verification of devices including onlineness
and classfication match is done afterwards, this shouldn't lead to
lost devices or missed hotplug events.

Unfortunately, it forgot to thaw the port when clearing EH_PENDING, so
if the condition happens after resetting an empty port, the port could
be left frozen and EH will end without thawing it, making the port
unresponsive to further hotplug events.

Thaw if the port is frozen after clearing EH_PENDING.  This problem is
reported by Bruce Stenning in the following thread.

Summary:
Maps are expensive to construct and manipulate, and in this case we don't need the `O(log n)` lookups that they provide. Plus, we actually convert these maps to lists anyway during init.

This is a very small saved state size win, and a decent saved state init time win.

I may explore doing something similar with the dependency graph, but I don't think there are significant wins to be had by doing something similar with the other fields here, since the others are consumed as maps so we would have to convert them to maps anyway, or make some more invasive change to Flow. I think it's unlikely to be worth it. The one exception is the dependency graph, which I might try converting at some point.

The weird extension bug is still there.
I honestly cannot see any reason for the inability of boss and boss1 to coexist. The names are different, they import different librarys, and the error message provided is completely non-sensical. No game at game.loadModeAsync? you can't even call the function if said error existed, how do you move into a directory successfully and then say the directory does not exist?
However, the second file to import (which is boss1) is the consistently broken one. The problem might be function override, which can still happen in javascript, but should not have any reason to happen because there is no commonity between these files in terms of reference. Also, function override should cause the second function to be the functional one, not the errored one.

samba-team/samba,5bd7f9c61bb2fea1867ac6657c9b30799ba49d8f,"s3: OneFS implementation of change notify

The OneFS Samba implementation of change notify is modeled after the
usage of Linux's inotify kernel subsystem.  A single call is made
into the onefs.so VFS module to initialize kernel tracking of certain
file change events.  When these events occur a kernel notification is
sent to smbd and the notification event is translated and given to the
general Samba Change Notify layer through a callback function.

The most difficult aspect is converting an SMB CompletionFilter to
a matching ifs_event mask, and then back to an appropriate change
notify action.  Currently, not all possible cases are handled by the
this module, but the most prevalent ones, which are tested by
smbtorture, are implemented.

GNOME/gnome-control-center,50b39dc570aaf0fc73016f6a647e11438497ad81,"wacom: Drop old_axes from calibration API

The calibration utility was modified in cf408c27b0 to return unitless
padding measurements instead of axis values for storage in gsettings.
Unfortunately, the code still assumes in some places that it is working
with axes rather than paddings. This causes subtle math errors that
result in undesired cursor offsets after the calibration is applied.

Fortunately, this can be simplified, since tablet area is always reset
to the default state before starting calibration, we are sure that the
value will remain constant. Since both axes are in the same 0..1 scale,
calibration code doesn't need to swap X/Y back and forth to calculate
each axis scale.

Additionally, the code to get the calibrated axis values has been moved
into its own function along with a new function that returns padding
values suitable for consumption by g-c-c. All calculations are performed
internally in the 0..1 range.

Summary:
All implementations of transports in practice were all AsyncTransportWrappers
(AsyncSocket, AsyncSSLSocket, AsyncFizzBase, etc.).

AsyncTransportWrapper was confusing. The only additional functionality that
it provided was the ability to query underlying transports, a piece of
functionality which makes just as much sense on AsyncTransport.

The simplified model:

""AsyncTransport deals with bidirectional I/O. It is both an AsyncReader, and
an AsyncWriter. It may be nested.""

This diff changes AsyncTransportWrapper usages in folly to refer to
AsyncTransport, and aliases AsyncTransportWrapper for compatibility.

*implemented a more hardware like approach to scaling, now to calculate the pixel scaling i use the xfb size not the efb so the screen pixels relation is more correct now.
*simplified a little donko's virtual xfb to make it less memory consuming as xfb textures are the exact size of the scaled xfb and not full target width.
* when it works even real xfb will let us use super sampling.

Taeung/tip,09a4c02e58c1b3d9748f78242962b7f63c68477e,"drm/i915: Look for an active kernel context before switching

We were not very carefully checking to see if an older request on the
engine was an earlier switch-to-kernel-context before deciding to emit a
new switch. The end result would be that we could get into a permanent
loop of trying to emit a new request to perform the switch simply to
flush the existing switch.

What we need is a means of tracking the completion of each timeline
versus the kernel context, that is to detect if a more recent request
has been submitted that would result in a switch away from the kernel
context. To realise this, we need only to look in our syncmap on the
kernel context and check that we have synchronized against all active
rings.

v2: Since all ringbuffer clients currently share the same timeline, we do
have to use the gem_context to distinguish clients.

As a bonus, include all the tracing used to debug the death inside
suspend.

v3: Test, test, test. Construct a selftest to exercise and assert the
expected behaviour that multiple switch-to-contexts do not emit
redundant requests.

Taeung/tip,05f4c350ee02e9461c6ae3a880ea326a06835e37,"NFS: Discover NFSv4 server trunking when mounting

""Server trunking"" is a fancy named for a multi-homed NFS server.
Trunking might occur if a client sends NFS requests for a single
workload to multiple network interfaces on the same server.  There
are some implications for NFSv4 state management that make it useful
for a client to know if a single NFSv4 server instance is
multi-homed.  (Note this is only a consideration for NFSv4, not for
legacy versions of NFS, which are stateless).

If a client cares about server trunking, no NFSv4 operations can
proceed until that client determines who it is talking to.  Thus
server IP trunking discovery must be done when the client first
encounters an unfamiliar server IP address.

The nfs_get_client() function walks the nfs_client_list and matches
on server IP address.  The outcome of that walk tells us immediately
if we have an unfamiliar server IP address.  It invokes
nfs_init_client() in this case.  Thus, nfs4_init_client() is a good
spot to perform trunking discovery.

Discovery requires a client to establish a fresh client ID, so our
client will now send SETCLIENTID or EXCHANGE_ID as the first NFS
operation after a successful ping, rather than waiting for an
application to perform an operation that requires NFSv4 state.

The exact process for detecting trunking is different for NFSv4.0 and
NFSv4.1, so a minorversion-specific init_client callout method is
introduced.

CLID_INUSE recovery is important for the trunking discovery process.
CLID_INUSE is a sign the server recognizes the client's nfs_client_id4
id string, but the client is using the wrong principal this time for
the SETCLIENTID operation.  The SETCLIENTID must be retried with a
series of different principals until one works, and then the rest of
trunking discovery can proceed.

FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer,007a52587fbb48f770d5b8e6a9a577b61c318aad,"minor #944 Enable caching of composer downloads on Travis (stof)

This PR was submitted for the 1.4 branch but it was merged into the 1.5 branch instead (closes #944).

Discussion
----------

Enable caching of composer downloads on Travis

This is possible thanks to 2 changes:

- the new docker-based infrastructure allows to use the cache for public repos too.
- since several months, Composer is smart enough to fallback to a source install in case it cannot download the dist, avoiding to break the build in case the Github API rate limit is reached on the Travis VM

And thanks to the usage of the cache, most downloads will not count in the API rate limit because they will never reach Github (only new versions will be downloaded when one of the dependencies makes a new release).

Note that the PR build will not show any improvement yet, because PR builds are loading the cache of their target branch, and the target branch does not have a cache yet of course.

The target of this PR is 1.4 so that all maintained branches will get this improvement.

Commit f2c31e32b378 (net: fix NULL dereferences in check_peer_redir() )
added a regression in rt6_fill_node(), leading to rcu_read_lock()
imbalance.

Thats because NLA_PUT() can make a jump to nla_put_failure label.

Fix this by using nla_put()

tprrt/linux-stable,84cb8eb26cb9ce3c79928094962a475a9d850a53,"net: sched: action_ife: take reference to meta module

Recent refactoring of add_metainfo() caused use_all_metadata() to add
metainfo to ife action metalist without taking reference to module. This
causes warning in module_put called from ife action cleanup function.

Implement add_metainfo_and_get_ops() function that returns with reference
to module taken if metainfo was added successfully, and call it from
use_all_metadata(), instead of calling __add_metainfo() directly.

Example warning:

Trello: https://trello.com/c/P3pynH7k/1092-spike-validate-learn-to-rank

This spike demonstrates how we can implement [Learning To Rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_to_rank)
using Tensorflow’s [ranking module](https://github.com/tensorflow/ranking).

The spike is functional, but not ready for merge.

What is Learning To Rank?

Learning To Rank (LTR) for our use case is the application of machine learning
to create a ranking model that can be used to improve search relevance.

This is a common approach for advanced search applications.

There is a good explanation on what LTR is here:

- https://elasticsearch-learning-to-rank.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core-concepts.html
- https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2017/02/24/what-is-learning-to-rank/

It is easiest to explain with an example:

Say you searched for 'Harry Potter'. Search API might return
the following results:

1. HMRC Sign in
2. Harry Potter World
3. Pottery barn
4. Harry Potter

These are not good results.

How do we improve search results currently?

Our approach now would be to manually rank these results,
giving them a score of between 0-3 (0 being irrelevant, 3 being
completely relevant):

```
query         rating    document
harry potter  0         HMRC Sign in
harry potter  2         Harry Potter World
harry potter  0         Pottery barn
harry potter  3         Harry Potter
```

These judgements are an expression of the ideal ordering.

We can then use nDCG to tell us how good the results are.
We might get a score of 0.3 for this result (from 0 to 1).

We could then investigate why the results are bad. Perhaps
there is a best bet. Or popularity might be pushing HMRC
docs. We can fix these things, then re-run nDCG, and
we might get 0.7 for this query. Good stuff.

This works, but doesn't scale well. Eventually this process
becomes a game of whack-a-mole. If we downgrade popularity
boosting, then this query might have better results, but
other queries might have worse results.

Hand-tuning relevance doesn't work very well because
field boosts are complex, and difficult to maintain.

Learning to Rank makes tuning relevance:

- automatable
- scalable
- more successful
- more maintainable (arguable)

LTR won't make relevance tuning easier. But it could make search
results more relevant.

How do we improve search results with Learn To Rank?

The end goal is to make search results more relevant, without
manually increasing the boost of a field.

We would go through the same process of rating the search results:

```
harry potter  0         Pottery barn
harry potter  3         Harry Potter
...
```

However, after doing this, we would train a model with this data
to rank the results better. The model would optimise for nDCG.

We would provide the model features, such as the fields we boost on.

For example, take the SVM dataset below for the query 'harry potter' (qid:1)

```
0 qid:1 popularity:0.3 title_score:0.2 description_score:0.3 recency:0.9 pagerank:5 ...
3 qid:1 popularity:0.1 title_score:0.6 description_score:0.7 recency:0.5 pagerank:2 ...
```

This data, in addition to many other graded query:document pairs
and their features can be used to train a model.

The model might learn that title and description scores are
slightly more useful that popularity and recency, and how much,
in certain circumstances.

Implementation

I chose to use [TensorFlow's ranking library](https://github.com/tensorflow/ranking)
for this.

TensorFlow is well supported, and the ranking library is under active
development.

I wanted to try https://github.com/o19s/elasticsearch-learning-to-rank, but
as we are using AWS Elasticsearch, we are not permitted to install custom plugins.

Architecture:

User searches
Search API pulls results out of Elasticsearch
Search API send results to LTR model served by TF Serving
LTR model returns results re-ranked
Search API returns results to user

The model is trained on implicit and explicit relevancy judgements. Ratings
are provided by manual raters and derived from user click data.

Features can added and improved on.

Notes on the code in this spike:

Within this spike there is a new module `LearnToRank` which contains
various utilities for training and using the ranking model.

We needed to rewrite NDCG outside of Elasticsearch because the re-ranking
happens outside of ES.

`LearnToRank::Reranker` is called after the results have been extracted from
Elasticsearch, it calls the separate process serving the model which
re-ranks the results.

There is also a directory of scripts for training and serving the model.

Results

This spike contains a working MVP of a ranking model that can be
trained with relevancy judgements to re-rank results at query-time.

The results are positive. For our existing dataset (explicit relevancy
judgements) the model gets a higher score (9.2) compared to the original (0.89).
This was done on local data, we might see different results in e.g. integration.

For the combined dataset (explicit and implicit sourced from GA) we
get a score of 0.88 with the model and the same score without. The
model has a very slightly higher score (0.88265 vs 0.88011).

I think this demonstrates that with some more work (data/feature
engineering), the model can outperform our existing search algorithm.

The model uses ndcg as one of the measures by which it trains itself,
so it's not surprising that it can get a better score.

We were able to beat our existing search's ndcg score within a
few days. This doesn't mean that search is better, just better
by this metric with these relevancy judgements available.

In Bloomberg's talk on their project, they devote half of the talk
to discussion of how they made query performance better after implementing
LTR. I was worried that our search performance might also be hit.

The re-ranking model is very quick. TF Serving is production ready;
I think any performance bottlenecks will be in ruby and Elasticsearch.

I didn't notice a performance hit, but I haven't done proper testing of this.

The code is not much more complex. Architecturally the application is more
complex. It requires a separate process to be running. It requires some
knowledge of machine learning concepts and Learn To Rank from developers
and product managers.

It's harder to do, but will lead to better results. I am unclear whether
this lead to a harder to maintain application.

Pros:

- Potentially significant improvements to relevancy
- This is a well trodden path, as many orgs use LTR (Airbnb, Wikimedia,
  commercial search engines, Bloomberg, Yelp, etc.)

Cons:

- Added architectural complexity
- Harder to build and debug in contrast to hand-tuning

Next Steps:

Aside from making this more robust so that it is production ready,
I see two main areas for further development:

- Further research into how we should implement Learn To Rank
- Feature engineering
- Acquiring more/better relevancy judgements

The tasks would be aimed at making the model give more precise
relevancy predictions, should we decide to proceed with LTR.

Specify firmware partition format by compatible string.

formats in ramips:

- denx,uimage
- tplink,firmware

It's unlikely but the firmware splitting might not work any longer for
the following boards, due to a custom header:

- EX2700: two uImage headers
- BR-6478AC-V2: edimax-header
- 3G-6200N: edimax-header
- 3G-6200NL: edimax-header
- BR-6475ND: edimax-header
- TEW-638APB-V2: umedia-header
- RT-N56U: mkrtn56uimg

But it rather looks like the uImage splitter is fine with the extra

- Add the charm to the environment

This patch corrects the chain of errors to have proper causes which implicitly corrects the error message to:

This device is the worst device I saw. It keeps TipSwitch and InRange
at 1 for fingers that are not touching the panel.
The solution is to rely on the field ContactCount, which is accurate
as the correct information are packed at the begining of the frame.

Unfortunately, CountactCount is most of the time at the end of the report.
The solution is to pick it when we have the whole report in raw_event.

Sorted and split apart the source/header files to isolate the GUI parts for separate pop-ups that cause problems in Emscripten.  Added configuration defines for the splash screen and application font loading so that they can be independently enabled/disabled on any platform.  Added configuration defines and split out the source files for database building and disabled that on the mobile and Emscripten targets, since they don't need it ever.  Updated build notes for building KJPBS in Emscripten.  Moved the startup error prompts to a special ReportError handler so that we can easily redefine how that's implemented -- with it being a QMessageBox on some targets or simple qDebug() logs on things like Emscripten.  Changed how our main CMyApplication object gets created, being on the heap now instead of the stack, as needed for Emscripten.  Changed code that caused dialogs to popup to not do so for Emscripten.  We might can bring some of this functionality back later, but it's easier to remove it now while we get the main part up and functioning.  Similarly, for simplicity, Emscripten emulates stealth mode for persistent setting functionality.
This now completely builds in Emscripten and will come up with the splash screen, but am still having some issues on the QtSql part with it loading our database (actually, even loading the sqlite3 module).  Worst case, I might setup a method to dump the database object as a standalone memory image format of some sort and use that in place of SQL for loading.  That may even work better for desktop, since we don't really need SQL.  Though we would have to do the same for the dictionary and things.

google/llvm-propeller,2b8c69204b1d37d91cc775d51af50df7f478cecd,"[Windows] Convert from UTF-8 to UTF-16 when writing to a Windows console

Summary:
Calling WriteConsoleW is the most reliable way to print Unicode
characters to a Windows console.

If binary data gets printed to the console, attempting to re-encode it
shouldn't be a problem, since garbage in can produce garbage out.

This breaks printing strings in the local codepage, which WriteConsoleA
knows how to handle. For example, this can happen when user source code
is encoded with the local codepage, and an LLVM tool quotes it while
emitting a caret diagnostic. This is unfortunate, but well-behaved tools
should validate that their input is UTF-8 and escape non-UTF-8
characters before sending them to raw_fd_ostream. Clang already does
this, but not all LLVM tools do this.

One drawback to the current implementation is printing a string a byte
at a time doesn't work. Consider this LLVM code:
  for (char C : MyStr) outs() << C;

Because outs() is now unbuffered, we wil try to convert each byte to
UTF-16, which will fail. However, this already didn't work, so I think
we may as well update callers that do that as we find them to print
complete portions of strings. You can see a real example of this in my
patch to SourceMgr.cpp

Fixes PR38669 and PR36267.

The STIX 2.0 specification recommends using the `sighting_of_ref` relationship type
be the sole relationship type between sighting entities and other STIX object types:

```
  {
    ""type"": ""sighting"",
    ""id"": ""sighting--ee20065d-2555-424f-ad9e-0f8428623c75"",
    ""created_by_ref"": ""identity--f431f809-377b-45e0-aa1c-6a4751cae5ff"",
    ""created"": ""2016-04-06T20:08:31.000Z"",
    ""modified"": ""2016-04-06T20:08:31.000Z"",
    ""first_seen"": ""2015-12-21T19:00:00Z"",
    ""last_seen"": ""2015-12-21T19:00:00Z"",
    ""count"": 50,
    ""sighting_of_ref"": ""indicator--8e2e2d2b-17d4-4cbf-938f-98ee46b3cd3f"",
    ""observed_data_refs"": [""observed-data--b67d30ff-02ac-498a-92f9-32f845f448cf""],
    ""where_sighted_refs"": [""identity--b67d30ff-02ac-498a-92f9-32f845f448ff""]
  },
```

However, we distinguish between two different kinds of Indicators:
1. Pattern-based indicators or engines (such as Snort rules or Threatbrain Indicators)
2. Observable-based indicators and feeds (such as IP blacklists, domain watchlists, etc.)

As the STIX 2.0 spec defines the ""indicates"" relationship type as something that only
*Indicators* do, and as we also follow this in our other data sources, I strongly recommend
that we revise our docs to bring the standard, recommended `relationship-types` for
sightings into alignment with judgements.

`matches` is a perfectly reasonable substitute for STIX's more verbose `sighting_of_ref`,
for pattern and rule-based indicators, such as Snort rules.

[body]

Reconfigured things so that the input orchestrator will only ever be
read from so there is no need to copy and modify it in place anymore.

Furthermore, the protocol for saving checkpoints should be faster
since we now just have to serialize the intermediate snapshot.

The update of the single checkpoint orch database doesn't require
serializing the whole thing and so we can update it in place. FOr this
I modified the _save_checkpoint method to do this in a way that is
completely transactional (I assume using the write-ahead log of
SQLite) and adds the new snapshot, removes the old one, removes the
old run record and adds the new one.

This is important since we are not just serializing the whole
strucutre and so we have to worry about data integrity. This solves
that problem.

The _gen_checkpoint is gone now since it really wasn't necessary.

Also there is another command that must be run to initialize the
database at the beginning of the run for the checkpoint
_init_checkpoint_db.

The other significant thing to note which won't change the CLI
interface inputs, but does change the way that files are outputted is
that the final orch file won't be craeted. This is a good thing. In
the past it was a highly inneficient thing that basically duplicated
the entire input orchestrator causing huge bloat. Instead the final
snapshot is written to the checkpoint.

So the checkpoint file (checkpoint.chk, which should be changed to
something better) is the only output containing snapshots. It contains
2 snapshots (start and end) at any time, a single configuration, no
metadata, and the run table (with 1 run in it). SO it is decently
lightweight.

Any other approach would require access to the main orchestrator
database, which causes a huge operational problem because potentially
many simulations will be needing access. This would require a
significantly more complex system for managing concurrent connections
that would probably end up causing a lot of problems (mainly because
if a process blocks and then fails (very likely) it would halt all
progress for the other simulations).

So I think it is a good tradeoff.

Still need to clear up some stuff, test it, and clean up the
documentation so still WIP.
