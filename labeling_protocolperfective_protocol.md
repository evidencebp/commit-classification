        1. Improving style is perfective yet not a refactor.
        1. Clean up not in code (e.g., documentation) is perfective but not a refactor 
        1. Fix documentation, adding documentation - perfective but not refactor.
        1. Indentation, code style changes  are perfective but not refactor
    
  Upgrading a library, is adaptive, not perfective is functionally is changed
  Bumping self version is perfective, not adaptive
  Gitignore actions are perfective
     When [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) appear, we base the decision upon them.
    The labels 'refactor', 'docs', and 'style' are perfective.
